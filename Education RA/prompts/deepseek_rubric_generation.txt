* ATTACH QUIZ FILE AND _answerless FILES *
Write me a grading rubric for q1_soln. I want it formatted as follows in a separate txt file - this format is the format of my answerless quiz file:

* INCLUDE SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM _answerless FILE *
### QUESTION 1
//// RUBRIC: [grading rubric for previous question]
### QUESTION 2
//// RUBRIC: [grading rubric for previous question]

In total, the number of //// RUBRIC: strings should be the same as the number of [number of # prepending questions in _answerless file] strings - [number of # prepending questions in _answerless file] signifies a question in this document. I will be using this rubric to grade written quizzes.
