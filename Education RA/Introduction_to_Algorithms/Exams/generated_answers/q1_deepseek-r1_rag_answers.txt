QUESTION: Describe a O(n)-time algorithm to determine the maximum amount of lottery winnings Tiff can win in the next n days by playing the lottery infrequently. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • Let L(i) be the cash payout of playing the lottery on day i ∈ {1,...,n} • Need to keep track of most recent two plays (or equivalently, restrictions on future plays) • x(i, j): maximum lottery winnings playing on suffix of days from i to n, assuming play on day i and next allowable play is on day i + j • for i ∈ {1,...,n} and j ∈ {1,..., 6} 2. Relate • Tiffany will play again on some day in future. Guess! • It is never optimal to go 11 days without playing the lottery, as playing on the 6th day would be valid and strictly increase winnings • The next play can be on day i + k for k ∈ {j, ... , 11} • If next play on i + k for k ∈ {1,..., 6}, next allowable play is on day i + 7 • If next play on i + k for k ∈ {7,..., 11}, next allowable play is on day i + k + 1 • x(i, j) = L(i) + max{x(i + k, max{1, 7 − k}) | k ∈ {i, ... , 11} and i + k ≤ n} 3. Topo • Subproblems x(i, j) only depend on strictly larger i, so acyclic 4. Base • x(n, j) = L(i) for all j ∈ {1,..., 6} 5. Original • Solve subproblems via recursive top-down or iterative bottom-up • Guess first play (within first seven days) • Solution to original problem is max{x(i, 1) | i ∈ {1,..., 7}} • (Can store parent pointers to reconstruct days played) 6. Time • # subproblems: 6n • work per subproblem: O(1) • work for original: O(1) • O(n) running time
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games that can be played over a given number of days, with the constraint that no two games can be played within 7 days of each other. 

### Approach
The key insight is to recognize that the optimal strategy involves scheduling games every 8 days starting from day 0. This ensures that there are at least 7 days between any two consecutive games. By following this approach, we can maximize the number of games played.

To compute the maximum number of games efficiently:
1. Add 7 to the total number of days. This adjustment helps in handling edge cases where the number of days is just enough to fit one more game.
2. Perform integer division by 8 on the result from step 1. This gives us the count of non-overlapping intervals of 8 days, each containing exactly one game.

### Solution Code
```python
def max_games(days):
    return (days + 7) // 8
```

### Explanation
- **Adding 7**: By adding 7 to the total number of days, we ensure that any partial interval is accounted for. For example, if there are 5 days, adding 7 gives us 12, which when divided by 8 gives 1 game.
- **Integer Division by 8**: This step calculates how many full intervals of 8 days can fit into the adjusted number of days. Each interval represents one game.

This approach efficiently computes the maximum number of games in constant time, O(1), making it highly efficient even for large values of days.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n^4)-time algorithm to determine whether Charlie is a fraud. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • Let A, B, and C be the relevant length-n DNA sequences from Alice, Bob, and Charlie. • Want to match some characters of A and B to all characters of C. • x(i, j, ki, kj): true if a length-ki subsequence of suffix A[i:] and a length-kj subsequence of prefix B[j:] can match all characters in suffix C[(n − ki − kj):] (the suffix containing the last ki + kj characters), and false otherwise. • Defined for i, j ∈ {0,...,n} and ki, kj ∈ {0,...,n/2} (assume n is even). 2. Relate • Must match character C[i]; if A[i] = C[i] or B[i] = C[i], recurse on remainder. • Alternatively, do not use either A[i] or B[i]. • The recurrence relation: x(i, j, ki, kj) = OR { x(i + 1, j, ki + 1, kj) if A[i] = C[n − ki − kj] and ki > 0, x(i, j + 1, ki, kj + 1) if B[j] = C[n − ki − kj] and kj > 0, x(i + 1, j, ki, kj) if i < n, x(i, j + 1, ki, kj) if j < n } 3. Topo • Subproblem x(i, j, ki, kj) only depends on strictly smaller i + j, so it is acyclic. 4. Base • x(n, n, 0, 0) is true (all matched!). • x(n, j, ki, kj) is false if ki > 0 (no more characters in A). • x(i, n, ki, kj) is false if kj > 0 (no more characters in B). 5. Original • Solve subproblems via recursive top-down or iterative bottom-up approach. • Solution to the original problem is x(n, n, n/2, n/2). 6. Time • Number of subproblems: O(n⁴). • Work per subproblem: O(1). • Overall time complexity: O(n⁴).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine whether Charlie is a fraud based on the provided algorithm, we follow these steps:

1. **Define Subproblems**:  
   We define `x(i, j, ki, kj)` as a boolean value indicating whether it's possible to match a subsequence of length `ki` from the suffix starting at index `i` in Alice's DNA sequence (A) and a subsequence of length `kj` from the prefix starting at index `j` in Bob's DNA sequence (B), such that all characters in Charlie's DNA sequence (C) from position `(n - ki - kj)` to the end are matched.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:  
   The recurrence relation is based on matching the next character of C with either A or B:
   - If `A[i]` matches `C[n - ki - kj]`, we can move to `x(i + 1, j, ki + 1, kj)`.
   - If `B[j]` matches `C[n - ki - kj]`, we can move to `x(i, j + 1, ki, kj + 1)`.
   - We also consider not using the current characters from A or B by moving to either `x(i + 1, j, ki, kj)` or `x(i, j + 1, ki, kj)`.

3. **Topological Order**:  
   The subproblems are processed in decreasing order of `i + j` because each subproblem depends on smaller indices, ensuring a dependency graph without cycles.

4. **Base Cases**:  
   - `x(n, n, 0, 0)` is true since all characters have been matched.
   - Any case where `ki > 0` and `i = n` or `kj > 0` and `j = n` results in false because there are no more characters to match.

5. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:  
   Using memoization, we compute the subproblems either recursively (top-down) with caching or iteratively (bottom-up). The solution is found in `x(0, 0, n/2, n/2)` after filling a table of all relevant subproblems.

6. **Time Complexity**:  
   - **Number of Subproblems**: O(n⁴), as each of the four variables (i, j, ki, kj) can independently take up to n values.
   - **Work per Subproblem**: O(1), since each involves a constant number of condition checks and logical operations.
   - **Total Time Complexity**: O(n⁴).

By following this algorithm, we efficiently determine if Charlie's DNA sequence can be matched with parts of Alice's and Bob's sequences, thus assessing Charlie's authenticity in the context provided.

QUESTION: Describe an O(nks)-time algorithm to find the maximum volume of food Obert can eat given his diet. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • x(i, j, s0): maximum volume of food possible when purchasing a suffix of plates pᵢ to pₙ₋₁, using at most j calories and ordering exactly s0 sweet plates. • Defined for i ∈ {0,...,n}, j ∈ {0,...,k}, s0 ∈ {0,...,s}. 2. Relate • Either order plate pᵢ or not. Guess! • If ordering pᵢ, gain vᵢ in volume but use cᵢ calories. • If pᵢ is sweet, must order one fewer sweet plate. • The recurrence relation: x(i, j, s0) = max { x(i + 1, j, s0), vᵢ + x(i + 1, j - cᵢ, s0 - sᵢ) if cᵢ ≤ j and sᵢ ≤ s0 } 3. Topo • Subproblems x(i, j, s0) only depend on strictly larger i, so it is acyclic. 4. Base • x(n, j, 0) = 0 for any j (no more plates to eat). • x(n, j, s0) = −∞ for s0 > 0 and any j (no more plates, but still need to eat sweet). 5. Original • Solution given by x(0, k, s). 6. Time • Number of subproblems: O(nks). • Work per subproblem: O(1). • Overall time complexity: O(nks).
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the maximum volume of food Obert can eat given his diet constraints using dynamic programming, we follow these steps:

1. **Define Subproblems**:  
   We define `x(i, j, s0)` as the maximum volume of food that can be eaten starting from the i-th plate to the end, with `j` calories remaining and having used `s0` sweet plates so far.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:  
   For each plate `i`, we have two choices: either eat it or not.
   - If Obert does not eat the i-th plate, the maximum volume remains as in `x(i + 1, j, s0)`.
   - If he eats the i-th plate:
     - Add its volume `v_i` to the total.
     - Subtract the calories consumed by this plate `c_i` from the remaining calories.
     - If the plate is sweet, decrement the count of sweet plates used by `s_i`.

   The recurrence relation is:
   ```
   x(i, j, s0) = max(
       x(i + 1, j, s0),  // Don't eat the i-th plate
       v_i + x(i + 1, j - c_i, s0 - s_i)  // Eat the i-th plate if possible
   )
   ```
   This is valid only if `j >= c_i` and `s0 >= s_i`.

3. **Topological Order**:  
   The subproblems are processed in decreasing order of `i`, ensuring that each subproblem depends on solutions to larger indices.

4. **Base Cases**:  
   - If all plates have been considered (`i = n`), the maximum volume is 0 if no constraints are violated: 
     ```
     x(n, j, s0) = 0
     ```
   - Otherwise, it's impossible to eat any more food without violating constraints:
     ```
     x(n, j, s0) = -∞ (or undefined)
     ```

5. **Solution Extraction**:  
   The solution is found in `x(0, k, s)`, where `k` is the maximum calorie limit and `s` is the maximum number of sweet plates allowed.

6. **Time Complexity**:  
   With `n` plates, `k` calories, and `s` sweet plates, there are `O(nks)` subproblems. Each state transition takes constant time, leading to a total time complexity of `O(nks)`.

By systematically evaluating each plate's inclusion or exclusion based on the remaining resources, we efficiently determine the optimal food-eating strategy for Obert.

QUESTION: Given the price lists of in-game purchases and ride sharing trips between all pairs of monsters, describe an O(n²)-time algorithm to determine the minimum amount of money Kash must spend in order to catch all n monsters, assuming that she starts at the location of monster m₁. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • x(i, j): minimum cost of catching monsters mᵢ to mₙ, starting at location mⱼ for j ≤ i. 2. Relate • If already at the location of monster mᵢ, catch it for free! • Otherwise, acquire monster mᵢ either by purchasing or ride-sharing to its location. Guess! • If purchasing, spend cᵢ dollars; otherwise, ride-share from mⱼ to mᵢ. • The recurrence relation: x(i, j) = min { x(i + 1, j) if j = i, cᵢ + x(i + 1, j), s(j, i) + x(i, i) } 3. Topo • Subproblems x(i, j) only depend on strictly larger i + j, so it is acyclic. 4. Base • x(n + 1, j) = 0 for any j (no cost when no monsters are left to catch). 5. Original • Solution given by x(1, 1). 6. Time • Number of subproblems: O(n²). • Work per subproblem: O(1). • Overall time complexity: O(n²).
//// ANSWER: 
The problem involves determining the minimum amount of money Kash must spend to catch all n monsters starting at monster m₁. The solution employs dynamic programming with subproblems defined as x(i,j), representing the minimum cost of catching monsters from m_i to m_n, starting at location m_j.

### Key Steps and Explanation:

1. **Subproblems Definition**:
   - `x(i,j)`: Minimum cost of catching monsters from m_i to m_n, starting at location m_j.
     - Here, i ranges from 1 to n, and j can be any position from 1 to i (since you start at or before the current monster).

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If Kash is already at m_i (j = i), she catches it for free: `x(i,i) = x(i+1,j)`.
   - Otherwise, she has two options:
     1. Buy monster i: Cost is c_i plus the cost of catching the rest (`c_i + x(i+1,j)`).
     2. Ride-share to reach m_i from j: Cost is s(j,i) plus the cost starting at m_i (`s(j,i) + x(i, i)`).

3. **Topological Order**:
   - Subproblems are processed in decreasing order of i (from n down to 1), ensuring that each subproblem depends only on larger indices.

4. **Base Case**:
   - When there are no more monsters to catch (`i = n+1`), the cost is zero: `x(n+1,j) = 0`.

5. **Algorithm Execution**:
   - Start from the base case and compute subproblems in reverse order.
   - The solution is found at `x(1,1)`, representing the minimum cost starting at m₁.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - There are O(n²) subproblems (each i has up to i possible j values).
   - Each subproblem requires constant time due to a fixed number of operations in the recurrence.
   - Total time complexity is O(n²).

### Conclusion:

The algorithm efficiently computes the minimum cost using dynamic programming with an O(n²) time complexity, ensuring optimal resource usage for the given problem constraints.

QUESTION: Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E, w) with positive and negative edge weights, and given a particular vertex v ∈ V, describe an O(k|E|)-time algorithm to return the minimum weight of any cycle containing vertex v that also has exactly k edges, or return that no such cycle exists. Recall that a cycle may repeat vertices/edges. //// ANSWER: Assume all vertices in G are reachable from v so that |V| = O(|E|); otherwise, run BFS or DFS to solve single source reachability from v, and replace G with the subgraph reachable from v in O(|E|) time. Construct a new graph G' = (V', E') with:• k + 1 vertices for each vertex v ∈ V: specifically vᵢ for all i ∈ {0, . . ., k}; and• k edges for each edge (u, v) ∈ E: specifically edges (uᵢ₋₁, vᵢ) for all i ∈ {1, ...,k}.Graph G' has (k + 1)|V| = O(k|E|) vertices and k|E| edges in k + 1 layers, and has the property that paths from v₀ to vₖ have a one-to-one correspondence with cycles through v in G of the same weight containing exactly k edges, since exactly one edge is traversed with each increase in layer. So solve SSSP from v₀ in G' to return the minimum weight path to vₖ. Since edges in G' always increase in subscript, G' is a DAG, so we can solve SSSP using DAG relaxation in linear time with respect to the size of G'. So together with initial pruning, this algorithm takes O(k|E|) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the minimum weight cycle containing vertex \( v \) with exactly \( k \) edges in a weighted directed graph \( G = (V, E, w) \), we can use a modified approach involving constructing an auxiliary graph and applying shortest path algorithms suitable for DAGs. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Approach

1. **Construct the Auxiliary Graph \( G' \):**
   - For each vertex \( v \in V \), create \( k + 1 \) nodes in \( G' \), denoted as \( v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k \).
   - For each edge \( (u, v) \) in the original graph \( G \), add an edge from \( u_i \) to \( v_{i+1} \) for all \( i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, k-1\} \).

2. **Properties of \( G' \):**
   - \( G' \) consists of \( (k + 1)|V| \) vertices and \( k|E| \) edges.
   - The graph is layered such that each layer corresponds to a step in the path, ensuring it's a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

3. **Single-Source Shortest Path in DAG:**
   - Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm optimized for DAGs by processing nodes layer by layer.
   - This involves relaxing edges from each layer \( i \) to \( i+1 \), ensuring that paths correspond exactly to cycles of length \( k \) in \( G \).

4. **Finding the Minimum Cycle Weight:**
   - Compute the shortest path distance from \( v_0 \) (the starting node at layer 0) to \( v_k \) (the ending node after exactly \( k \) steps).
   - If such a path exists, its weight is the minimum cycle weight in \( G \). If no such path exists, return that no cycle of length \( k \) containing \( v \) exists.

### Solution Code

```python
import heapq

def find_min_cycle_weight(G_prime, start_vertex, target_vertex):
    """
    G_prime: The auxiliary graph with (k+1) layers.
    start_vertex: The vertex in the first layer (v_0).
    target_vertex: The vertex in the k-th layer (v_k).

    Returns:
        The minimum weight of a cycle containing v with exactly k edges, or None if no such cycle exists.
    """
    # Initialize distances
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in G_prime.nodes}
    dist[start_vertex] = 0

    # Process each layer from 0 to k-1
    for i in range(k):
        current_layer = [node for node, layer in G_prime.nodes.items() if layer == i]
        next_layer = [node for node, layer in G_prime.nodes.items() if layer == i+1]
        for u in current_layer:
            for v in next_layer:
                if G_prime.has_edge(u, v):
                    weight = G_prime.get_edge_weight(u, v)
                    if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight:
                        dist[v] = dist[u] + weight

    # Check the distance to target_vertex
    min_weight = dist[target_vertex]
    return min_weight if min_weight != float('inf') else None

# Example usage:
# Assuming G_prime is constructed as described, and start_vertex is v_0,
# target_vertex is v_k.
min_cycle_weight = find_min_cycle_weight(G_prime, v_0, v_k)
```

### Explanation

- **Auxiliary Graph Construction:** By creating \( k + 1 \) layers for each vertex, we ensure that paths through these layers correspond to cycles of exactly \( k \) edges in the original graph.
  
- **DAG Processing:** Since \( G' \) is a DAG due to its layered structure, we can efficiently compute shortest paths using an optimized version of Bellman-Ford, processing each layer sequentially.

- **Finding the Cycle Weight:** The distance from \( v_0 \) to \( v_k \) in \( G' \) gives the minimum weight cycle containing \( v \) with exactly \( k \) edges. If this distance remains infinity after processing all layers, it indicates no such cycle exists.

This approach efficiently leverages the properties of DAGs and layered graphs to solve the problem within a time complexity suitable for large graphs.

QUESTION: Given a 3-color labeling c : E → {red, green, blue} of a connected, weighted, undirected graph G = (V, E, w) containing only positive edge weights, and given two vertices s,t ∈ V, describe an efficient algorithm to return a path from s to t having minimum color cost. //// ANSWER: Construct a new graph G' = (V', E') with:• 3 vertices for each vertex v ∈ V: specifically vᵢ for i ∈ {red, green, blue} corresponding to arriving at vertex v via an edge with color i;• (vertex-edges) 3 undirected edges for each vertex v ∈ V: specifically {vred, vblue}, {vgreen, vred}, and {vblue, vgreen} of weight wc; and• (edge-edges) 1 undirected edge for each undirected edge {u,v} ∈ E of weight w and color c(u, v): specifically undirected edge {uc(u,v), vc(u,v)} with weight w.Graph G' has 3|V| vertices and 3|V| + |E| edges, and has the property that the minimum weight of any path in G' from any vertex sᵢ to any vertex tⱼ for i, j ∈ {red, green, blue} is equal to the minimum color cost of any 3-color labeled path in G from s to t, as switching colors at a vertex requires traversing an edge of weight w. So solve SSSP three times, once from each vertex sᵢ and find the minimum weight of any path to any tⱼ, and then return a minimum path by constructing parent pointers as shown in lecture. Since this graph only has positive edge weights, we can solve SSSP using Dijkstra in O(|V| + |E| + |V|log |V|) = O(|E| + |V|log|V|) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding a path from \( s \) to \( t \) with the minimum color cost in the given graph \( G \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Construct the New Graph \( G' \):**
   - For each vertex \( v \) in \( G \), create three vertices: \( v_{\text{red}} \), \( v_{\text{green}} \), and \( v_{\text{blue}} \).
   - Connect these color vertices with edges of the same weight as the original edges. Specifically, add edges:
     - \( (v_{\text{red}}, v_{\text{green}}) \) with weight corresponding to a green edge,
     - \( (v_{\text{green}}, v_{\text{blue}}) \) with weight corresponding to a blue edge,
     - \( (v_{\text{blue}}, v_{\text{red}}) \) with weight corresponding to a red edge.
   - For each original edge \( \{u, v\} \) in \( G \) with color \( c \) and weight \( w \), add an edge between \( u_c \) and \( v_c \) in \( G' \) with the same weight \( w \).

2. **Run Dijkstra's Algorithm Three Times:**
   - Run Dijkstra's algorithm once from each of the starting vertices corresponding to \( s \): \( s_{\text{red}} \), \( s_{\text{green}} \), and \( s_{\text{blue}} \).
   - This will compute the shortest paths from these starting points to all other vertices in \( G' \).

3. **Find the Minimum Path:**
   - After running Dijkstra's algorithm, examine the distances from any of the three starting points (\( s_{\text{red}} \), \( s_{\text{green}} \), \( s_{\text{blue}} \)) to all possible endpoints for \( t \): \( t_{\text{red}} \), \( t_{\text{green}} \), and \( t_{\text{blue}} \).
   - The minimum distance among these will give the shortest path from \( s \) to \( t \) considering all possible color sequences.

4. **Reconstruct the Path:**
   - Using the parent pointers recorded during each run of Dijkstra's algorithm, trace back from the vertex with the minimum distance at \( t \) through its predecessors until reaching the starting point.
   - This reconstructed path represents the optimal sequence of colors and edges that minimizes the total color cost.

By following these steps, we efficiently find the path with the minimum color cost using dynamic programming principles and Dijkstra's algorithm. The approach ensures that all possible color transitions are considered while maintaining computational efficiency due to the positive edge weights in \( G \).

**Answer:**

The optimal path from \( s \) to \( t \) with the minimum color cost can be found by constructing a new graph \( G' \), running Dijkstra's algorithm three times from each starting color of \( s \), and selecting the shortest path ending at any color of \( t \). The final path is reconstructed using parent pointers. 

The minimum color cost path is:

\[
\boxed{\text{Minimum distance found after considering all color sequences}}
\]

QUESTION: Ranger Raargorn needs to deliver a message from her home town of Tina's Mirth to the town of Riverdell, but the towns of Midgard have been overrun by an army of k Orks. Raargorn has a map of the n towns and 3n roads in Midgard, where each road connects a pair of towns in both directions. Scouts have determined the number of Orks rᵢ ≥ 1 stationed in each town i (there is at least one Ork stationed in each town). Describe an O(k)-time algorithm to find a path from Tina's Mirth to Riverdell on which Raargorn will encounter the fewest total Orks in towns along the way. //// ANSWER: Construct a graph G = (V, E) with:• a chain of rᵢ vertices (v₁, ..., vᵣᵢ) connected by rᵥ – 1 edges for each town v, i.e., unweighted directed edge (vᵢ, vᵢ₊₁) for all i ∈ {1, . . ., rᵥ − 1}; and• two unweighted directed edges (vᵣᵥ, u₁) and (vᵣᵥ, u₁) for each road between towns u and v.Graph G has ∑ rᵥ = k vertices and 2(3n) + ∑(rᵥ − 1) = 5n + k edges. Since there is at least one Ork in each town, k ≥ n, so G has size O(k). Let s and t correspond to the towns of Tina's Mirth and Riverdell respectively. Graph G has the property that any path from s₁ to tᵣ₁ corresponds to a path from Tina's Mirth to Riverdell crossing edges equal to the number of Orks encounters in towns along the way, since for any road connecting towns u and v, going from u₁ to v₁ requires traversing rᵥ edges in G. So solve unweighted SSSP from s₁ to tᵣ₁ using BFS in O(k) time, and return the sequence of towns visited along the found shortest path by following parent pointers.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding a path from Tina's Mirth to Riverdell with the fewest encounters of Orks, we can model the scenario using a graph where each town is expanded into multiple vertices representing its Orks. Here's how:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Each town \( v_i \) with \( r_i \) Orks becomes a chain of \( r_i \) vertices in graph \( G \).
   - These chains are connected by edges: each vertex \( v_{i,j} \) is connected to \( v_{i,j+1} \) for all valid \( j \), forming a linear chain.
   - For every road between towns \( u \) and \( v \), add directed edges from the last vertex of \( u \)'s chain (\( v_{u,r_u} \)) to both first vertices of \( v \)'s chain (\( v_{v,1} \)).

2. **Graph Properties**:
   - The total number of vertices in \( G \) is \( k = \sum r_i \), which is linear with respect to the original towns.
   - The edges are constructed such that moving from one town's vertex chain to another represents traversing all Orks at a town.

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Since each edge has an equal weight (representing one Ork), we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in terms of edges, which corresponds to minimizing the total number of Orks encountered.
   - BFS is efficient for unweighted graphs and runs in \( O(k + m) \) time where \( k \) is vertices and \( m \) is edges. Here, it's linear relative to \( k \), making it suitable.

4. **Path Interpretation**:
   - The shortest path found via BFS corresponds to the sequence of towns with the least total Orks.
   - By following parent pointers from the target town (Riverdell) back to the start (Tina's Mirth), we reconstruct this optimal path.

Thus, using this graph model and BFS ensures an efficient \( O(k) \)-time solution to find the minimal Ork encounter path.

QUESTION: Given a cycle-sparse graph, describe an O(|V|³)-time algorithm to return the number of negative-weight cycles in G. //// ANSWER: Construct a new graph G' by adding a supernode x to G with a zero-weight directed edge (x, v) for each v ∈ V. Then run SSSP from x in G' using Bellman-Ford to label each vertex v ∈ V with its shortest path distance δ(x, v). For each v ∈ V, δ(x,v) = −∞ if and only if v is reachable from a negative-weight cycle in G (since adding x does not add or remove any cycles). Further, for any directed edge (u, v), if δ(x, u) = δ(x,v) = -∞, then both u and v are each reachable from the same simple negative-weight cycle (since v is reachable from u and each vertex is reachable from at most one simple negative-weight cycle).So, construct a new graph G" on only the vertices v ∈ V where δ(x,v) = −∞ in G', with an undirected edge between u and v in G" if they share a directed edge in G. Graph G" has the property that the number of connected components in G" equals the number of negative-weight cycles in G, so count and return the number of connected components in G" using Full-BFS or Full-DFS. This algorithm takes O(|V|+|E|) time to construct G', O(|V||E|) time to run Bellman-Ford, O(|V|+|E|) time to construct G", and then O(|V|+|E|) time to count connected components in G", leading to an O(|V||E|) = O(|V|³) running time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm described efficiently counts the number of negative-weight cycles in a graph with an O(|V|³) time complexity by leveraging a supernode approach and analyzing connectivity.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Add Supernode:** Introduce a new node `x` connected to every other node with zero-weight edges, creating a new graph G'.

2. **Bellman-Ford Run:** Execute Bellman-Ford starting from `x` on G'. This identifies nodes reachable from any negative cycle by marking them with δ(x, v) = -∞.

3. **Construct G'':** Form a subgraph G'' consisting only of nodes marked as reachable (δ(x, v) = -∞). Connect two such nodes with an edge in G'' if there's an edge between them in the original graph G.

4. **Count Components:** The number of connected components in G'' equals the number of distinct negative-weight cycles in G.

**Answer:**

The algorithm works by identifying nodes reachable from negative cycles, grouping these into a subgraph where each connected component corresponds to one cycle. Thus, the number of such components gives the count of negative-weight cycles.

\boxed{\text{Number of connected components in } G''}

QUESTION: Assuming she departs s at half capacity, [b/2], describe an O(nlogn)-time algorithm to determine the maximum amount of energy Bellham can have in her battery upon reaching t. //// ANSWER: Construct graph G with a vertex for each of the n locations in Norway and a directed edge for each of the O(n) roads: specifically for each road from location u to v, add directed edge (u, v) weighted by J(u,v). Then [b/2] minus the weight of a minimum-weight path from s to t in G would correspond to the maximum energy Bellham could have upon reaching t; or at least it would be if she did not either exceed or exhaust her tank along the way.First we show that every minimum-weight path from s to t in G is simple. It suffices to show that every directed cycle in G has positive weight. Consider cycle (c₀, ..., cₖ₋₁, cₖ = c₀). C has weight ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ J(cᵢ₋₁, cᵢ) > ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ mg(h(cᵢ) - h(cᵢ₋₁)) = 0, as desired.Any simple path in G traverses at most n - 1 edges, so the magnitude of its weight is at most (n - 1)k < b/2. Thus [b/2] minus the weight of any simple path in G will always be > 0 and < b (so Bellham cannot exhaust or exceed her tank by driving on a simple path from s to t).Lastly, we find the weight of a minimum-weight path from s to t by solving SSSP. Unfortunately using Bellman-Ford takes O(n²) time which is too slow. However, we can re-weight edges in G to be positive while preserving shortest paths by exploiting the provided vertex potentials, similar to Johnson's algorithm. Specifically, create new graph G', identical to G, except change the weight of each edge (u, v) to J(u, v) – mg(h(v) – h(u)) > 0. This transformation preserves shortest paths since the weight of each path from, e.g., a to b changes by the same amount, namely by mg(h(b) – h(a)). So run Dijkstra from s to find the minimum weight D of any path to t in G', and return [b/2] – (D – mg(h(b) – h(a))).Constructing G takes O(n) time, reweighting to G' also takes O(n) time, and then running Dijkstra from s in G' takes O(n log n) time, leading to O(n log n) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the maximum amount of energy Bellham can have in her battery upon reaching point \( t \), we model the scenario as a graph where each node represents a location, and directed edges represent roads between them. The edge weights are based on elevation changes (J(u,v)). 

1. **Graph Construction**: Construct graph \( G \) with nodes for each location and directed edges for roads, weighted by J(u,v).

2. **Weight Transformation**: Create transformed graph \( G' \) where each edge weight is adjusted to be positive: \( J'(u,v) = J(u,v) - mg(h(v) - h(u)) \). This ensures all weights are non-negative.

3. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm on \( G' \) starting from node \( s \) to find the minimum weight path to \( t \).

4. **Battery Calculation**: The maximum remaining battery energy is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Energy} = \frac{b}{2} - (D - mg(h(t) - h(s)))
   \]
   where \( D \) is the shortest path weight in \( G' \).

This approach ensures that Bellham's battery does not exceed its capacity and efficiently computes the maximum remaining energy using an optimal path.

**Answer**: The maximum amount of energy Bellham can have upon reaching point \( t \) is calculated by subtracting the minimum path cost from her initial half-battery charge, adjusted for elevation changes. This results in a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \), making it efficient for large graphs.

QUESTION: For each function, state its worst-case running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n²)
//// ANSWER: 
The worst-case running times for each function, based on the context provided, can be determined as follows:

1. **Dynamic Programming Subproblems**: The number of subproblems is given as Θ(n·F), where n represents the number of notes and F could relate to the number of fingers or similar parameters.

2. **Work per Subproblem**: Each subproblem involves Θ(F) work, indicating that each decision affects subsequent steps.

3. **Total Complexity Calculation**: Multiplying the number of subproblems (Θ(n·F)) by the work per subproblem (Θ(F)) results in a total complexity of O(n·F²). However, if F is considered as part of another parameter or under certain constraints where it simplifies to a constant factor, the time could be approximated as O(n²).

4. **User's Request**: The user mentioned functions with worst-case running times of O(n²), suggesting that when considering specific parameters (like n and k), each function's complexity is bounded by O(n²).

**Conclusion**: For each function, assuming n and k are related such that the product simplifies to a quadratic term, the worst-case running time is **O(n²)**.

QUESTION: For each function, state its expected running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n)
//// ANSWER: 
The expected running times for each function are as follows:

For each function, its running time in terms of \( n \) and \( k \) is stated as \( O(n) \). This indicates that the complexity grows linearly with respect to \( n \), while \( k \) does not significantly affect the overall performance. 

Answer: For each function, the expected running time is \( O(n) \).

QUESTION: For each function, state its worst-case running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n + k)
//// ANSWER: 
The worst-case running time for each function is **O(n + k)**. This suggests that for each function call or processing step, the algorithm operates in linear time relative to two parameters: n and k. The analysis likely considers factors such as the number of notes (n) and another variable (k), which could represent transitions between states or next steps in a dynamic programming approach.

Answer: O(n + k).

QUESTION: For each function, state its expected running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n + k)
//// ANSWER: 
The expected running times for various functions in terms of their parameters \( n \) and \( k \) are typically expressed using Big-O notation to describe their asymptotic complexity. Here's a general approach:

1. **Identify the Parameters**: Determine how each function scales with respect to both \( n \) (input size) and \( k \) (another parameter, such as a constraint or an additional variable).

2. **Analyze Each Function**:
   - For functions where time grows linearly with both parameters, the running time is \( O(n + k) \).
   - If one function depends primarily on \( n \), it might be \( O(n) \).
   - Similarly, a function depending mainly on \( k \) would have \( O(k) \).

3. **Apply to Specific Functions**: Without specific functions, we can't provide exact times, but for any given algorithm involving parameters \( n \) and \( k \), the running time is determined by how much each parameter affects the operations.

In summary, each function's expected running time in terms of \( n \) and \( k \) is analyzed to determine its Big-O complexity, which helps in understanding how it scales with input size and other parameters.

QUESTION: State which item(s) in the array could have the key with the smallest integer //// ANSWER: A
//// ANSWER: 
The item in the array that could have the key with the smallest integer is the one at position 0. 

**Answer:** The first item in the array, which corresponds to index 0, has the smallest integer as its key.

QUESTION: State which item(s) in the array could have the key with the third smallest integer //// ANSWER: B, C, D, E, F, G
//// ANSWER: 
The items with keys equal to the third smallest integer are B, C, D, E, F, and G.

**Answer:** The items are B, C, D, E, F, and G.

QUESTION: State which item(s) in the array could have the key with the largest integer //// ANSWER: F, G, H, I, J
//// ANSWER: 
The items F, G, H, I, J could have keys with the largest integers because they likely correspond to finger assignments for particularly challenging notes in a sequence where each finger has an associated difficulty value. These fingers are used for notes that result in higher difficulty values compared to others.

**Answer:** The items F, G, H, I, and J could have keys with the largest integers as they represent finger assignments for notes with higher difficulty levels.

QUESTION: State the array representation of H, first before and then after performing the operation H.delete_max(). //// ANSWER: Before: [93, 85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17] After: [85, 63, 38, 23, 17, 11, 13]
//// ANSWER: 
The array representation of H before performing delete_max() is:

Before: [93, 85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]

After deleting the maximum element (93), the array becomes:

After: [85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]

QUESTION: Perform operation S.delete_at(3) on S including any rotations, and then list the items stored in the leaves of s in traversal order, after the operation has completed. //// ANSWER: (17,85, 11, 13)
//// ANSWER: 
The operation `delete_at(3)` is performed on the B-tree structure `S`, which involves removing the element at position 3. Since B-trees maintain their elements in sorted order and allow efficient deletions, this operation does not disrupt the overall order of the leaves except for the specific deletion.

After performing the delete operation, the items stored in the leaves are listed in traversal order as follows:

(17, 85, 11, 13)

This result reflects the state of the tree after the deletion and any necessary restructuring to maintain its properties.

QUESTION: For House Puffle Huff, students must be sorted by friend number, i.e., how many of the other n 1 incoming students they are friends with, which can be determined in O(1) time. //// ANSWER: Friend numbers are non-negative integers less than n, so we can use counting sort to sort the students in worst-case O(n) time. (Radix sort also works with the same running time.) Since we have to compute friend number for each student, any algorithm will take at least Ω(n) time, so this is optimal.
//// ANSWER: 
The students must be sorted by the number of incoming friends they have. Since friend numbers are non-negative integers less than \( n \), we can use counting sort to achieve a worst-case \( O(n) \) time complexity. This is optimal because any sorting algorithm will require at least \( \Omega(n) \) time, and counting sort matches this lower bound perfectly.

**Answer:**  
Yes, the students can be sorted in \( O(n) \) time using counting sort based on their friend numbers.

QUESTION: For House Craven Law, students must be sorted by the weight of their books. Book weights cannot be measured precisely, but the Sorting Sock has a scale that can determine in O(1) time whether one set of books has total weight greater than, less than, or equal to another set of books. //// ANSWER: A scale weighing is a comparison with a constant number of outcomes, so the comparison sort Ω(nlogn) lower bound applies. So we cannot do better than by using an worst-case O(nlogn) sorting algorithm, e.g., merge sort, using the scale to compare one student's books against another's.
//// ANSWER: 
The students at House Craven Law must be sorted using a comparison-based approach due to the limitations of the Sorting Sock scale. Each comparison (using the scale) has a constant time complexity, O(1). However, since comparison-based sorting algorithms have a lower bound of Ω(n log n), any algorithm used for this task will require at least that many comparisons in the worst case.

This means that regardless of how efficient each individual comparison is, the overall time complexity cannot be improved beyond O(n log n) due to the inherent limitations of comparison-based methods. Therefore, algorithms like merge sort or quicksort are appropriate choices, as they achieve this lower bound with a time complexity of Θ(n log n).

Answer: The students must be sorted using an algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of Ω(n log n), such as merge sort, due to the limitations imposed by comparison-based sorting.

QUESTION: For House Driven Gore, students must be sorted by bravery, which can't be directly measured or quantified, but for any set of students, the Sorting Sock can determine the bravest among them in O(1) time, e.g., by presenting the students with a scary situation. //// ANSWER: We can't quantify bravery, so we can't hope to use any integer-based algorithms. However, the Sorting Sock can find a student of maximum bravery in O(1) time, so we repeatedly find and select a bravest student among all previously unselected students in worst-case O(n) time, which is again optimal. (This is priority queue sort, using the Sorting Sock as the priority queue to find the maximum.)
//// ANSWER: 
The problem involves sorting students based on their bravery, which cannot be directly measured but can be determined using the Sorting Sock tool that finds the maximum (bravest) student in O(1) time. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Initialization**: Start with all students as unsorted.

2. **Finding the Max**: Use the Sorting Sock to identify the bravest student in the current subset of unsorted students. This operation is O(1).

3. **Sorting Process**:
   - Place the identified student at the beginning of the sorted list.
   - Remove this student from the pool of unsorted students.

4. **Repeat**: Continue steps 2 and 3 until all students are placed in the sorted list.

This method works because each use of the Sorting Sock tool efficiently finds the next maximum element, allowing us to build the sorted list one by one without needing numerical comparisons or complex data structures. The total time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of students, making it an optimal solution for this problem.

**Answer**: Yes, we can sort the students in linear time using the Sorting Sock tool by repeatedly finding and selecting the maximum (bravest) student until all are sorted. This approach ensures efficiency without relying on numerical comparisons or complex data structures beyond the provided tool's functionality.

QUESTION: For House Leather Skin, students must be sorted by their magical lineage: how many of a student's ancestors within the previous 3[log n] + 4 generations were magical. Recall that humans, magical or not, always have two parents in the previous generation, unlike binary tree nodes which have at most one. Assume the Sorting Sock can compute the magical lineage of a student in O(1) time. //// ANSWER: Each student has at most 2k ancestors in the kth generation preceding. Thus the number of wizard ancestors will be a non-negative number bounded above by 3 3 [log n]+4 2k < 23(logn+1)+5 = 2823 logn = 28n3log2 = O(n) for any c > 3 log 2. Thus we can use radix sort to sort the students by their magical lineage in worst-case O(n) time, which is again optimal.
//// ANSWER: 
To efficiently sort students based on their magical lineage counts within the previous \( 3 \log n + 4 \) generations, we can use a radix sort algorithm. Here's how:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each student has a lineage count that grows exponentially with each generation due to two parents per generation. Over \( k = 3 \log n + 4 \) generations, this results in up to \( O(n^3) \) ancestors.

2. **Radix Sort Approach**:
   - Treat each lineage count as a number.
   - Use radix sort with sufficient digits (e.g., base 10 or another suitable base).
   - Each digit represents a part of the lineage count, allowing us to sort students progressively from the least significant to the most.

3. **Efficiency**: Radix sort operates in linear time per pass and requires \( O(\log n) \) passes for numbers up to \( O(n^3) \), leading to an overall efficient sorting process with complexity \( O(n \log n) \).

**Answer**: Use a radix sort algorithm, treating each student's lineage count as a number. By processing each digit of the count from least significant to most, you can efficiently sort all students within linear time relative to the number of elements and digits needed for their lineage counts.

\boxed{\text{Use radix sort based on the lineage counts}}

QUESTION: Given three arrays A, B, C, each containing n integers, give an O(n²)-time algorithm to find whether some a ∈ A, some b ∈ B, and some c∈ C have zero sum, i.e., a + b + c = 0. State whether your running time is worst-case, expected, and/or amortized. //// ANSWER: For each pair of numbers (a, b) ∈ A × B, store a + b in a hash table H. Then return Yes if -c appears in H for any c ∈ C, and return No otherwise. Correctness: If any -c appears in H for any c∈ C, then –C a' + b' for some (a', b') ∈ A × B so a' + b + c = 0. Otherwise, there is no c∈ C for which -c = a' + b' for any (a', b') ∈ A × B. Running Time: There are O(n²) pairs in A × B, so inserting them into H takes expected O(n²) time. Then checking whether each -c appears in H takes expected O(1) time each, and expected O(n) in total. So this algorithm runs in expected O(n²) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm involves checking for triplets (a, b, c) where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C such that a + b + c = 0.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Compute All Possible Sums of Pairs from A and B:**
   - For each element `a` in array A and each element `b` in array B, compute the sum `sum_ab = a + b`.
   - Store all these sums in a hash table (or set) for quick lookup.

2. **Check Each Element in C:**
   - For each element `c` in array C, check if `-c` exists in the hash table created in step 1.
   - If `-c` is found, it means there exist elements `a` from A and `b` from B such that `a + b = -c`, which implies `a + b + c = 0`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If any element `c` in C satisfies the condition (i.e., `-c` is found in the hash table), return "Yes".
   - If no such triplet is found after checking all elements in C, return "No".

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

- The algorithm runs in O(n²) time because:
  - Computing all pairs from A and B takes O(n * n) = O(n²) operations.
  - Checking each element in C against the hash table is an O(1) operation per check, resulting in an overall O(n) time for this step.

**Space Complexity:**

- The space complexity is dominated by the storage of all sums from A and B, which requires O(n²) space. However, since the problem specifies an O(n²)-time algorithm, we assume that space constraints are manageable within this framework.

This approach efficiently determines whether a triplet (a, b, c) exists with the desired sum using a hash table for quick lookups after precomputing all possible sums from A and B.

QUESTION: Given a Sequence AVL Tree T containing n nodes, and a pointer to a node v from T, describe an O(log n)-time algorithm to return the (zero-indexed) index i of node v in the traversal order of T. //// ANSWER: Our algorithm will be to walk up the tree from v to the root r of the Sequence AVL Tree, counting the nodes preceding v in the traversal order along the way, since the number of nodes preceding v in the tree is equivalent to v's (zero-indexed) index. Let #v(u) be the number of vertices preceding v in a vertex u's subtree, where v is in the subtree of u. Then #v(v) = v.left.size if v has a left child and zero otherwise; and can be computed in O(1) time. Then, for every ancestor of u starting from v, we compute #v(u.parent) from #(u). There are two cases: • Case 1, u is the left child of u.parent: then all the nodes preceding v in the subtree of u.parent are in the subtree of u, so set #v(u.parent) = #(u). • Case 2, u is the right child of u.parent: then all nodes in the left subtree of u.parent precede v (as does u), so set #v(u.parent) = 1+u.parent.left.size + #v(u). Then return #v(r), since this is the number of nodes preceding v in r's subtree (i.e., the entire tree). Correctness is argued within the algorithm description. This algorithm spends worst-case O(1) work for each ancestor of v, so since the Sequence AVL Tree is balanced, the number of ancestors is bounded by O(log n), and the algorithm runs in worst-case O(log n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
It is not possible to determine the exact index of a node in an AVL tree solely based on the number of insertions or other simple parameters, as the position depends on multiple factors including balance factors and subtree sizes. Therefore, there isn't a direct formula for this without more information about the tree's structure after insertion.

Answer: It is not possible to determine the index without additional structural information; thus, no expression can be provided based solely on insertions into an AVL tree.

QUESTION: Describe a database supporting the following operations, where k is the number of recorded but unpatched holes in the network at the time of the operation. //// ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain the following data structures: • A Set AVL tree Tp for each pipe p containing all the unpatched holes in p keyed by hole distance • A Hash Table D mapping each pipe p to its tree Tp • A Binary Min Heap Q containing each consecutive pair of holes (p, d1, d2) appearing on the same pipe p with key being the distance |d2 – d₁| between them, and any lonely holes (p, d) (holes that are alone on their pipes) with key ∞ (when multiple stored items have the same key, we store them in a Hash Table keyed by (p, d1, d2) or (p, d)) • A Hash Table C mapping each consecutive hole pair (p, d1, d2) or lonely hole (p, d), to their location in Q.
//// ANSWER: 
To implement the database supporting the specified operations, we use the following data structures:

1. **Tp (Set AVL Tree)**: For each pipe \( p \), an AVL tree is maintained to store all unpatched holes keyed by their distance from a reference point on the pipe. This allows efficient insertion and deletion of hole distances.

2. **D (Hash Table)**: Maps each pipe \( p \) to its corresponding AVL tree \( Tp \). This provides quick access to the hole data for any given pipe.

3. **Q (Binary Min Heap)**: Contains entries that include either consecutive pairs of holes on the same pipe or lonely holes. The heap is keyed by distance, with lonely holes having a key of infinity. This allows efficient retrieval of the closest pair of holes or the farthest hole from its neighbors.

4. **C (Hash Table)**: Maps each entry in \( Q \) (either consecutive hole pairs or lonely holes) to their specific position within the heap. This facilitates quick access to these entries during operations.

This structure ensures that all operations can be performed efficiently, with each pipe's data managed by an AVL tree for optimal performance and the heap providing a fast way to manage and retrieve hole information based on proximity. The hash tables enable quick lookups between pipes and their corresponding trees or heap entries, ensuring overall efficiency in handling network segment operations.

This setup effectively manages unpatched holes by leveraging per-pipe data storage with an AVL tree for each pipe, a mapping from pipes to these structures via \( D \), a min-heap for efficient distance-based queries, and a hash table for quick access to heap elements. This combination ensures that the database can efficiently handle operations related to patching holes or analyzing network segments, even as the number of unpatched holes (\( k \)) changes over time.

ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain the following data structures: • A Set AVL tree \( Tp \) for each pipe \( p \) containing all the unpatched holes in \( p \) keyed by hole distance • A Hash Table \( D \) mapping each pipe \( p \) to its tree \( Tp \) • A Binary Min Heap \( Q \) containing each consecutive pair of holes (p, d1, d2) appearing on the same pipe \( p \) with key being the distance \( |d2 – d₁| \) between them, and any lonely holes (p, d) (holes that are alone on their pipes) with key ∞ (when multiple stored items have the same key, we store them in a Hash Table keyed by (p, d1, d2) or (p, d)) • A Hash Table \( C \) mapping each consecutive hole pair (p, d1, d2) or lonely hole (p, d), to their location in \( Q \).

QUESTION: Describe a database supporting the following worst-case operations: //// ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain a single Set AVL Tree T containing each user ID and their status, keyed by ID. In additional, augment each node x in T with four subtree properties: • x.size: the number of IDs in the subtree (as discussed in lecture). • x.suffix = (d, m): the smallest ID d in the subtree for which each of the m IDs d' ≥ d in the subtree is active, or None. Computable in O(1) time as either the suffix (dr, MR) of the right subtree, or if MR is equal to the size of the right subtree and × is active, return the suffix (dL, ML) of the left subtree but add MR + 1 to M₁ (or (x.key, MR + 1) if left suffix is None). • x.prefix = (d, m): the largest ID d in the subtree for which each of the m IDs d' ≤ d in the subtree is active, or None. Computable in O(1) time as either the prefix (d₁, ML) of the right subtree, or if m₁ is equal to the size of the left subtree and × is active, return the prefix (dR, MR) of the right subtree but add ML+1 to MR (or (x.key, m₁+1) if right prefix is None). • x.substring = (a,b,m): a, b are IDs from the subtree where each of the m IDs d in the subtree with a ≤ d ≤ b is active and m is maximized. Computable in O(1) time by tak- ing the max of the substring within either left or right subtree, or the substring spanning the two subtrees if x is active. Specifically, consider the substrings of left and right subtrees, (AL, BL, ML) and (ar, bR, MR) respectively, and then if x is active, consider the suffix of the left subtree (d₁, m'₁) and the prefix of the right subtree (dR, M'R). Then depending on which of (m₁, m'₁ + 1 + M'R, MR) is the largest, return (a₁, bŁ, M₁), (d₁, dR, M'₁ + 1 + m'₨), or (AR, BR, MR) respectively.
//// ANSWER: 
To address the problem of augmenting an AVL Tree with additional properties (suffix, prefix, and substring) representing active ID ranges, we can follow a structured approach:

### Approach
1. **Augment Node Properties**: Each node in the AVL Tree will store:
   - `size`: The number of nodes in its subtree.
   - `suffix`: The smallest ID such that all IDs from this point upwards are active.
   - `prefix`: The largest ID such that all IDs from some minimum up to this point are active.
   - `substring`: A range [a, b] where all IDs within this range are active.

2. **Size Calculation**: The size of a node is the sum of its left and right subtree sizes plus one (for itself). This can be computed recursively during insertion or deletion.

3. **Suffix Property**:
   - If the right child has a suffix, propagate it up if all IDs from the right's suffix to the current node are active.
   - Otherwise, check the left child's suffix and adjust based on whether the current node is part of an active range.

4. **Prefix Property**:
   - Similar to the suffix property but in reverse order (from minimum upwards).
   - Propagate the prefix from children if all IDs up to the current node are active.

5. **Substring Property**:
   - Compute based on the maximum substring from left or right child.
   - If the current node is active, combine ranges from both children where they overlap.

6. **Tree Balancing**: After each insertion or deletion, ensure the tree remains balanced using standard AVL Tree techniques to maintain O(log n) operations.

### Solution Code

### Explanation
- **Augmented Node Properties**: Each node now holds additional information (`suffix`, `prefix`, `substring`) to track active ID ranges.
- **Size Calculation**: Ensures each node knows its subtree size, crucial for balancing operations.
- **Suffix and Prefix Propagation**: These properties are updated based on children's values, ensuring correct active range tracking.
- **Substring Calculation**: Combines the current node's value with its children's substrings to form valid ranges.

This approach ensures efficient management of active ID ranges within an AVL Tree, supporting operations like insertion, deletion, and balancing in logarithmic time.

QUESTION: 2^{2η} ∈ Θ(2η). //// ANSWER: False. This statement is equivalent to saying k² ∈ O(k) for k = 2n. Constants in exponents matter asymptotically!
//// ANSWER: 
The statement \(2^{2\eta} \in \Theta(2^\eta)\) is **False**. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding Big Theta (Θ):**
   - A function \(f(\eta)\) is in \(\Theta(g(\eta))\) if there exist positive constants \(c_1\), \(c_2\), and an integer \(k_0\) such that for all \(\eta > k_0\):
     \[ c_1 g(\eta) \leq f(\eta) \leq c_2 g(\eta) \]

2. **Comparing the Functions:**
   - Here, \(f(\eta) = 2^{2\eta}\) and \(g(\eta) = 2^\eta\).
   - Simplify \(f(\eta)\): \(2^{2\eta} = (2^{\eta})^2\).

3. **Checking Upper Bound (\(O\) notation):**
   - We need to find if there exists a constant \(c_2\) such that:
     \[ 2^{2\eta} \leq c_2 \cdot 2^\eta \]
   - Simplify: 
     \[ (2^{\eta})^2 \leq c_2 \cdot 2^\eta \implies 2^\eta \leq c_2 \]
   - As \(\eta\) grows, \(2^\eta\) becomes larger than any constant \(c_2\), so this inequality cannot hold for all large \(\eta\).

4. **Checking Lower Bound (\(Ω\) notation):**
   - We need to find if there exists a constant \(c_1\) such that:
     \[ 2^{2\eta} \geq c_1 \cdot 2^\eta \]
   - Simplify:
     \[ (2^{\eta})^2 \geq c_1 \cdot 2^\eta \implies 2^\eta \geq c_1 \]
   - As \(\eta\) grows, \(2^\eta\) becomes larger than any constant \(c_1\), so this inequality holds.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the upper bound does not hold (as shown in step 3), there are no constants that satisfy both conditions for all sufficiently large \(\eta\).
   - Therefore, \(2^{2\eta}\) is not asymptotically bounded above by \(2^\eta\), and thus:
     \[ 2^{2\eta} \notin \Theta(2^\eta) \]

**Final Answer:**  
The statement \(2^{2\eta} \in \Theta(2^\eta)\) is **False**.

QUESTION: If T(n) = 2T (n) + n² and T(1) = Θ(1), then T(n) = O(n²). //// ANSWER: False. This is an example of Case II of Master Theorem, since a = 1, b = 3, f(n) = n² and n² = O(nlog3/29/4 log n). Thus, the recurrence evaluates to T(n) = O(n² log n), which is not O(n²).
//// ANSWER: 
The given recurrence relation \( T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + n^2 \) can be analyzed using either the Akra-Bazzi method or the Master Theorem.

1. **Using the Master Theorem:**
   - Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( f(n) = n^2 \).
   - Compute \( \log_b a = \log_2 2 = 1 \).
   - Since \( f(n) = n^2 \) is asymptotically larger than \( n^{1} \), it falls under **Case III** of the Master Theorem.
   - Thus, \( T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) = \Theta(n^2) \).

2. **Using the Akra-Bazzi Method:**
   - For \( T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + n^2 \), we find \( p \) such that \( 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^p = 1 \).
   - Solving gives \( p = 1 \).
   - The integral becomes \( \int_{1}^{n} \frac{u^2}{u^{2}} du = n - 1 \), leading to \( T(n) = \Theta(n^2) \).

Both methods confirm that the time complexity is \( \Theta(n^2) \). Therefore, the initial assertion that it's False because of an \( O(n^2 \log n) \) bound was incorrect.

**Answer:** The correct asymptotic behavior is \( \boxed{\Theta(n^2)} \), so the statement is True.

QUESTION: Performing an O(1) amortized operation n times on an initially empty data structure takes worst-case O(n) time. //// ANSWER: True. This is the definition of amortization.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. Performing n operations, each with an amortized time of O(1), results in a worst-case time complexity of O(n) because the average cost per operation remains constant when spread across all operations.

**Answer:**  
True. Performing n O(1) amortized operations on an initially empty data structure leads to a worst-case time complexity of O(n).

QUESTION: Given an array A containing n comparable items, sort A using merge sort. While sorting, each item in A is compared with O(log n) other items of A. //// ANSWER: False. As a counter example, during the final merge step between two sorted halves of the array, each of size O(n), a single item from one array may get compared to all the items from the other list.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement that each item in an array sorted by merge sort is compared with \( O(\log n) \) other items is **true**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Merge Sort Overview:**
   - Merge sort works by recursively dividing the array into halves until each subarray contains a single element.
   - It then merges these subarrays back together in a sorted manner.

2. **Merging Process:**
   - During each merge, elements from two subarrays are compared one by one to form a combined sorted array.
   - Each element is involved in comparisons at each level of the recursion tree.

3. **Number of Levels (Recursion Depth):**
   - The recursion depth for an array of size \( n \) is \( O(\log n) \), as each split halves the array until reaching individual elements.

4. **Comparisons per Element:**
   - At each level, each element is compared once with another element from the other subarray.
   - Since there are \( O(\log n) \) levels, each element participates in \( O(\log n) \) comparisons across all merges.

5. **Total Comparisons:**
   - The total number of comparisons per element grows logarithmically with the size of the array, making it \( O(\log n) \).

**Conclusion:** Each item is indeed compared with \( O(\log n) \) other items during the merge sort process.

QUESTION: Given a binary min-heap storing n items with comparable keys, one can build a Set AVL Tree containing the same items using O(n) comparisons. //// ANSWER: False. If such an algorithm A existed, we would be able to sort an array of comparable items in O(n) time, which would contradict the Ω(n log n) comparison sort lower bound. Specifically, we could build a binary min-heap from the array using O(n) comparisons, use A to construct a Set AVL Tree in O(n) comparisons, and then return its traversal order.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is false. If there were an algorithm A that could build a Set AVL Tree from a binary min-heap in O(n) comparisons, this would imply that we can sort any array in linear time (O(n)), which directly contradicts the well-known Ω(n log n) lower bound for comparison-based sorting algorithms. Since such an algorithm cannot exist due to the established computational limits, the answer is:

**False**

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Binary Min-Heap Construction**: Typically requires O(n) time using sift-down operations.
2. **AVL Tree Construction**: Normally takes O(n) time with amortized constant factors per operation.
3. **Sorting Implication**: If an O(n) algorithm for building the AVL tree existed, it would allow sorting in linear time, violating the Ω(n log n) lower bound.
4. **Conclusion**: Such an algorithm cannot exist, making the original statement false.

Answer: False

QUESTION: Given a directed graph G = (V, E), run breadth-first search from a vertex s ∈ V. While processing a vertex u, if some v ∈ Adj+(u) has already been processed, then G contains a directed cycle. //// ANSWER: False. BFS can't be used to find directed cycles. A counterexample is V = {s, a, b,t} and E = {(s, t), (s, a), (a, b), (b, t)}. Running BFS from s will first process vertices in levels {s}, then {a, t}, then {b}. When processing vertex b, vertex t ∈ Adj+(b) has already been processed, yet G is a DAG.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is false. BFS does not reliably detect directed cycles as demonstrated by the given counterexample.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding BFS and Cycles:**
   - BFS (Breadth-First Search) is primarily used for traversing graphs level by level, often to find shortest paths or connected components.
   - It does not inherently detect cycles unless specifically implemented with tracking of visited nodes.

2. **Analyzing the Counterexample:**
   - The graph G = (V, E) has vertices V = {s, a, b, t} and edges E = {(s,t), (s,a), (a,b), (b,t)}.
   - This forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as all edges are directed without creating any loops.

3. **BFS Traversal Process:**
   - Starting from s, BFS processes nodes in the order: s → {a, t} → b.
   - When processing node b, its neighbor t is already marked as visited because it was processed earlier when connected to s.

4. **Interpreting the Edge (b,t):**
   - The edge from b to t indicates a directed path but does not form a cycle since there's no return path from t back to b or any ancestor of b.
   - BFS detects that t has been visited, but this doesn't imply a cycle because all edges are directed away from s and towards t.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The presence of an already processed node in the adjacency list during BFS does not necessarily indicate a directed cycle.
   - Therefore, BFS cannot reliably detect directed cycles as it might process nodes in such a way that back edges don't form actual cycles.

**Final Answer:**  
The statement is false. BFS does not reliably detect directed cycles because processing an already visited node can occur without forming a cycle, as shown in the provided counterexample.

QUESTION: Run Bellman-Ford on a weighted graph G = (V, E, w) from a vertex s ∈ V. If there is a witness v ∈ V, i.e., δινι(ς,υ) < διν−1(s, v), then v is on a negative- weight cycle of G. //// ANSWER: False. A witness is only guaranteed to be reachable from a negative- weight cycle; it may not actually be on a negative-weight cycle.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is false. A vertex \( v \) with \( \delta(s, v) < \delta_{n-1}(s, v) \) indicates that the shortest path to \( v \) can be improved after \( n-1 \) relaxations. This implies that \( v \) is reachable from a negative-weight path but does not necessarily mean it lies on a negative-weight cycle. The vertex could be part of a longer path with a lower total weight, without being cyclic.

**Answer:**  
The statement is false. A witness \( v \) in Bellman-Ford indicates that the shortest path to \( v \) can still be improved after \( n-1 \) relaxations but does not necessarily mean \( v \) is on a negative-weight cycle; it could be part of another reachable path with lower weight.

QUESTION: Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's Algorithm solve all-pairs shortest paths in the same asymptotic running time when applied to weighted complete graphs, i.e., graphs where every vertex has an edge to every other vertex. //// ANSWER: True. A complete graph is dense, i.e., |E| = Θ(|V|²), so Johnson's algorithm runs in O(|V|² log |V| + |V||E|) = O(|V|³) time, which is the same as Floyd-Warshall.
//// ANSWER: 
Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's Algorithm both solve all-pairs shortest paths with an asymptotic time complexity of O(n³) when applied to weighted complete graphs.

**Answer:**  
True. Both Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's algorithms run in O(n³) time for a complete graph, making their asymptotic running times the same.

QUESTION: If there is an algorithm to solve 0-1 Knapsack in polynomial time, then there is also an algorithm to solve Subset Sum in polynomial time. //// ANSWER: True. Subset Sum is the special case of 0-1 Knapsack. Specifically, one can (in linear time) convert an instance (A, T) of Subset Sum into an equiv- alent instance of 0-1 Knapsack, with an item i for each integer aż ∈ A having size si = ai and value v₁ = ai, needing to fill a knapsack of size T; and then solve the instance via the polynomial-time algorithm for 0-1 Knapsack.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**. Here's why:

1. **Subset Sum as a Special Case of 0-1 Knapsack**: By converting each element into an item with weight and value equal to its value in the subset, we transform the Subset Sum problem into a 0-1 Knapsack instance where the target is T.

2. **Polynomial-Time Reduction**: The transformation from Subset Sum to Knapsack can be done in linear time relative to the size of the input set.

3. **Implications for P vs NP**: If a polynomial-time algorithm exists for 0-1 Knapsack, it would imply that Subset Sum (and by extension, all NP-Complete problems) can also be solved in polynomial time, leading to the conclusion that P=NP.

Thus, if such an algorithm exists for 0-1 Knapsack, it directly provides a polynomial-time solution for Subset Sum.

QUESTION: Suppose a decision problem A has a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm to solve A. If P ≠ NP, then A is not solvable in polynomial time. //// ANSWER: False. A problem could have a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm and a polynomial-time algorithm. In fact, any polynomial-time algorithm is also a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm!
//// ANSWER: 
The answer is False because a problem with a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm can still have a polynomial-time solution even if P ≠ NP.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Algorithms:**
   - A **polynomial-time (P) algorithm** runs in O(n^k), where n is the input size and k is a constant.
   - A **pseudopolynomial-time algorithm** has a running time dependent on both the numeric value of the input (like C) and its size, such as O(n * C^k).

2. **Relationship Between P and PP:**
   - Every polynomial-time algorithm is inherently pseudopolynomial because it fits within the broader definition.
   - The existence of a pseudopolynomial algorithm does not preclude the possibility of a more efficient (polynomial) solution.

3. **Implications of P ≠ NP:**
   - If P ≠ NP, certain problems cannot be solved in polynomial time and require pseudopolynomial approaches for specific instances.
   - However, this doesn't affect other problems that might still have polynomial solutions independent of P vs NP.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The presence of a pseudopolynomial algorithm for problem B does not imply it lacks a polynomial solution.
   - Therefore, even if P ≠ NP, B could still be solvable in polynomial time alongside its pseudopolynomial counterpart.

**Answer:** False. A decision problem with a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm can still have a polynomial-time solution regardless of whether P equals NP or not.

QUESTION: Given a connected undirected weighted graph G = (V, E, w), where every edge has a unique integer weight, describe an O(|E|log |E|)-time algorithm to determine the largest value of k such that Gk is not connected. //// ANSWER: Construct an array A containing the |E| distinct edge weights in G, and sort it in O(|E|log |E|) time, e.g., using merge sort. We will binary search to find k. Specifically, consider an edge weight k' in A (initially the median edge weight), and run a reachability algorithm (e.g., Full-BFS or Full-DFS) to compute the reachability of an arbitrary vertex x ∈ V in O(|E|) time. If exactly V vertices are reachable from x, then Ge is connected and k > k'; recurse on strictly larger values for k'. Otherwise, Gk is not connected, so k ≤ k'; recurse on non-strictly smaller values for k'. By dividing the search range by a constant fraction at each step (i.e., by always choosing the median index weight of the unsearched space), binary search will terminate after O(log |E|) steps, identifying the largest value of k such that Gk is not connected. This algorithm takes O(|E|log |E|) time to sort, and computes reachability of a vertex in O(|E|) time, O(log |E|) times, so this algorithm runs in O(|E| log |E|) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm to determine the largest value of \( k \) such that \( G_k \) is not connected involves the following steps:

1. **Sort the Edge Weights**: Begin by sorting all the unique edge weights in ascending order.

2. **Binary Search Setup**: Initialize the binary search with the minimum and maximum possible weights from the sorted list.

3. **Midpoint Check**:
   - For each midpoint weight \( k' \), construct a subgraph \( G_{k'} \) using all edges with weights ≤ \( k' \).
   - Perform a reachability check (using BFS or DFS) starting from an arbitrary vertex to determine if the entire graph is connected.

4. **Adjust Search Range**:
   - If \( G_{k'} \) is disconnected, set the lower bound of the search to \( k' + 1 \) because we are looking for the largest \( k \).
   - If \( G_{k'} \) is connected, set the upper bound to \( k' - 1 \).

5. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that edge cases such as all edges included or excluded are handled correctly.

6. **Efficiency Considerations**: Each connectivity check runs in \( O(|E|) \) time, and with binary search taking \( O(\log |E|) \) steps, the total complexity is \( O(|E| \log |E|) \).

By following these steps, we efficiently determine the largest \( k \) where \( G_k \) remains disconnected.

**Answer**: The algorithm sorts the edge weights and uses binary search with reachability checks to find the maximum \( k \), resulting in an overall time complexity of \( O(|E| \log |E|) \).

QUESTION: Describe an O(nd)-time algorithm to determine whether it is possible for Dal and Sean to drive from Yew Nork to Fan Sancrisco in at most d days, spending at most b on expenses along the way. //// ANSWER: Let C = {Co, . . ., Cn-1}, and let cs denote Yew Nork and let ct denote Fan Sancrisco. Construct a graph G with: • a vertex (ci, d') for each city c₁ ∈ C and day d' ∈ {0, . . ., d}, representing staying the night in city c₁ on the night before day d'; and • a directed weighted edge ((ci, d'), (cj, d' + 1)) with weight g(ci, Cj) + h(cj) for each city ci ∈ C, cj ∈ Li and d' ∈ {0, . . ., d – 1}. Then the weight of any path in G from vertex (cs,0) to any vertex (ct, d') for d' ∈ {0,...,d} corresponds to the expenses incurred along a driving route from Yew Nork to Fan Sancrisco in at most d days (assuming they stay the night upon reaching ct; other assumptions are also okay). G is acyclic, since each edge always connects a vertex from a smaller day to a larger day, so run DAG Relaxation to compute single-source shortest paths from (cs, 0) in G. Then return whether d((cs, 0), (Ct, d')) ≤ b for any d' ∈ {0,...d}. G has O(nd) vertices and O(nd) edges (since |Li| ≤ 10 for all i∈ {0,...,n – 1}), so DAG relaxation runs in O(nd) time and checking all destination values takes O(d) time, leading to O(nd) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine if Dal and Sean can drive from Yew Nork (cs) to Fan Sancrisco (ct) in at most \( d \) days while spending no more than \( b \) dollars on expenses, we model their journey as a graph problem with specific constraints. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Each vertex is represented as \( (c_i, d') \), where \( c_i \) is a city and \( d' \) is the day before arriving at that city.
   - The graph includes edges from each city on day \( d' \) to cities reachable on day \( d' + 1 \).
   - Each edge has a weight that combines the driving cost between cities and any additional costs in the destination city.

2. **DAG Relaxation**:
   - Since the graph is acyclic (days increase monotonically), we use DAG relaxation to compute shortest paths from the starting vertex \( (cs, 0) \).
   - This method efficiently finds the minimum cost paths considering all possible routes within the given day constraints.

3. **Cost Check**:
   - After computing the shortest paths, check if any path ending at \( ct \) on or before day \( d \) has a total cost ≤ \( b \).

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The graph has \( O(nd) \) vertices and edges, leading to an \( O(nd) \) time complexity for DAG relaxation.
   - Checking all destination values takes \( O(d) \) additional time.

By following these steps, we can determine if the trip is feasible within the specified budget and timeframe. 

**Answer**: Yes, it's possible to model their journey as described and check feasibility in \( O(nd) \) time using DAG relaxation.

QUESTION: Given G, c, a red vertex s ∈ Vr, and a blue vertex t ∈ V♭, describe an O(|V|)-time algorithm to compute d(s, t), the minimum weight of any path from s to t. //// ANSWER: Any path from s to t is a path through edges in Er, followed by a path through edges in Eg, followed by a (possibly empty) path through edges in Eb. So we compute minimum weight distances in G incrementally, first using edges in Er, then using edges in Eg, then edges in Eb. Step 1: Construct unweighted graph G' = (V', E') composed of the edges E' = Er and the vertices appearing in those edges, specifically V' = U(u,v)∈E, {u, v} (which contains vertices from V and Vg). Run breadth-first search from s in G' to compute unweighted distances. Then the minimum weight distance in G from s to any green vertex in V' ∩ V, is wr times the unweighted distance computed. G' has size O(|V|), so this step takes O(|V|) time. Step 2: Now construct weighted graph G" = (V", E") composed of vertex s with a new directed edge to each green vertex in V' ∩ V, weighted by its distance found in Step 1 (i.e., the minimum weight of any path from s to that vertex), along with weighted edges Eg and the vertices appearing in those edges. All the weights in G" are positive, so run Dijkstra from s in G" to compute minimum weight distances. Then the computed distance to any blue vertex v in V" ∩ V is the minimum weight of any path from s to v in G that traverses only red or green edges. G" has size O(1 + |Vg| + |Eg|) = O(|V|0.99), so this step takes O(|V|0.99 log |V|0.99) = O(|V|) time. Step 3: Now construct a weighted graph G''' = (V''', E''') composed of vertex s with a new directed edge to each blue vertex in V" ∩ V weighted by its distance found in Step 2 (i.e., the minimum weight of any path from s to that vertex), along with weighted edges E♭ and the vertices appearing in those edges. Weights in G'' may be positive or negative, so run Bellman-Ford from s in G'' to compute weighted minimum weight distances. Then the computed distance to t is the minimum weight of any path from s to t in G, as desired. G'' has size O(1 + |V6| + |E6|) = O(√VI), so this step takes O(√[V]√[V]) = 0(|V|) time, leading to O(|V|) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm efficiently computes the minimum weight path from a red vertex s to a blue vertex t by leveraging different graph traversals based on edge types:

1. **BFS on Er Edges:** Compute unweighted shortest paths from s, establishing initial distances for green vertices.

2. **Dijkstra with Eg Edges:** Use these distances as starting points in a weighted graph with only green edges to find the shortest paths considering both previous and current weights.

3. **Bellman-Ford with Eb Edges:** Handle any potential negative weights in blue edges by using this algorithm, ensuring all possible paths are considered for the minimum weight.

This approach ensures each step is efficient, leading to an overall O(|V|) time complexity.

**Answer:**

The described algorithm efficiently computes the minimum weight path from a red vertex s to a blue vertex t through three steps:

1. **BFS on Er Edges:** Compute unweighted shortest paths from s in G', using these distances as weights for green vertices.
2. **Dijkstra with Eg Edges:** Find shortest paths in G'' considering both previous and current edge weights, ensuring positivity.
3. **Bellman-Ford with Eb Edges:** Handle potential negative weights in blue edges to accurately compute the minimum path.

Each step ensures efficiency, resulting in an overall O(|V|) time complexity.

//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm to count the number of (m, k)-separated subsets of a set S is based on dynamic programming with subproblems defined by suffixes and sums. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Sorting**: The integers in S are sorted into an array A in increasing order.

2. **Subproblem Definition**: Define x(i, j) as the number of (j, k)-separated subsets starting from index i in A.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If including A[i], find f(i), the smallest index where A[f(i)] - A[i] ≥ k. Then add x(f(i), j - A[i]) to account for subsets that include A[i].
   - If excluding A[i], consider x(i+1, j).

4. **Base Cases**:
   - x(n, 0) = 1 (empty subset).
   - x(n, j) = 0 for j > 0.

5. **Topological Order**: Process subproblems in decreasing order of i to ensure dependencies are resolved correctly.

6. **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n²m) time due to the nested loops and linear scans required for each subproblem.

This approach efficiently counts valid subsets while respecting the separation constraint, using a dynamic programming strategy that builds solutions incrementally from smaller subproblems.

QUESTION: Given Ted's guest information, describe an O(n³)-time algorithm to determine a respectful seating order that minimizes the sum of mutual hatred between pairs of guests seated next to each other. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • Sort the guests increasing by favor in O(n log n) time into F = (fo, ..., f2n-1) • Any partition of F into two length-n subsequences corresponds to a respectful seating • x(i, JL, JR, N₁): minimum total hatred of adjacent guests possible by respectfully seating the n i guests from suffix F[i:] next to the Queen, with n₁ guests to the left and NR = (n - i) - n₁ guests to the right, where guest j₁ < i has already been seated n₁ +1 places to the left, and guest jR < i has already been seated NR + 1 places to the right. • for i∈ {0, . . ., 2n}, JL, JR ∈ {−1, ..., 2n − 1} and n₁ ∈ {0,...,n} where either j₁ = i − 1 or j₨ = i − 1 • Let d(−1,i) = d(i, −1) = 0 for all i ∈ {0, . . ., 2n – 1} (no hatred at the end of table) 2. Relate • Guess whether guest i is seated on the right or left • Sitting next to j₁ costs hatred d(i, j₁); sitting next to JR costs hatred d(i, jr) x(i, JL, JR, NL) =min d(i, j₁) + x(i + 1, i, jR, NL − 1) if n₁ > 0, d(i, jr) + x(i + 1, jŁ, i, n₁) if (n - i) - n₁ > 0 3. Topo: Subproblem x(i, JL, JR, NL) only depends on strictly larger i, so acyclic 4. Base: x(2n, JL, JR, 0) = 0 for all jL, JR ∈ {0, . . ., 2n} (no hatred if no guests) 5. Original: x(0, -1, -1, n), min hatred of adjacent guests by respectfully seating all guests 6. Time • # subproblems: though there are four parameters, there are only O(n³) subproblems for which either j₁ = i 1 or j = i -1 • Work per subproblem: O(1), so O(n³) time in total
//// ANSWER: 
The problem involves determining a respectful seating order that minimizes mutual hatred between adjacent guests. The approach uses dynamic programming (DP) with the following components:

1. **Subproblems**: Defined as `x(i, JL, JR, NL)`, representing the minimum total hatred for seating i guests from the suffix starting at F[i], where:
   - JL: Last guest seated on the left.
   - JR: Last guest seated on the right.
   - NL: Number of guests yet to be seated on the left.

2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each subproblem, choose between placing the next guest on the left or the right:
   ```
   x(i, JL, JR, NL) = min(
       x(i+1, J_L_new, JR, NL),  // Placed on the left
       x(i+1, JL, J_R_new, NL-1)  // Placed on the right
   )
   ```

3. **Base Case**: When all guests are seated (i = 2n), there's no hatred left:
   ```
   x(2n, JL, JR, 0) = 0
   ```

4. **Topological Order**: Subproblems are solved in decreasing order of i to ensure dependencies are resolved first.

5. **Complexity**: The number of subproblems is O(n³), and each subproblem takes constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(n³).

By systematically considering all possible seating arrangements through DP, the algorithm ensures that the optimal solution with minimal mutual hatred is found efficiently.

QUESTION: Given an array A containing n distinct positive integers, describe an O(n²)-time algorithm to determine whether four integers from A form a Pythagorean Quad, where integers from A may appear more than once in the Quad. State whether your running time is worst-case, expected, and/or amortized. //// ANSWER: First, we observe that it suffices to find (a, b, c, d) such that a² + b² = d² – c². Let P be the set of n² ordered pairs of integers from A, where integers in A may be repeated in a pair. Construct an empty hash table H, and for each pair (a, b) ∈ P, compute and insert value a² + b² into H. Then for each pair (c, d) ∈ P, compute and lookup value d² – c² in H. If the value is in H, then some a² + b² equals some d² – c², so return that a Pythagorean Quad exists. Otherwise, if no d² - c² exists in H, then return that a Pythagorean Quad does not exist. Each a² + b² or d² – c² value takes constant time to compute, so computing them all takes worst-case O(n²) time, while inserting them into or looking them up in the hash table takes expected O(n²) time, so this algorithm runs expected in O(n²) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm described works as follows:

1. **Generate All Ordered Pairs**: Create all possible ordered pairs (a, b) from the array A. This results in n² pairs since each element can pair with itself or any other.

2. **Compute Sums and Store in Hash Table**: For each pair (a, b), compute s = a² + b² and store these sums in a hash table H. This allows O(1) average-time lookups to check if a particular sum exists.

3. **Check for Valid Quadruples**: For each ordered pair (c, d), compute t = d² - c² and check if t is present in the hash table H. If t is found, it means there exists some (a, b) such that a² + b² equals d² - c².

4. **Return Result**: If any valid t is found during the checks, return that a Pythagorean Quad exists; otherwise, conclude that no such quad exists.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible combinations in O(n²) time on average using a hash table for quick lookups.

**Answer:**  
The algorithm runs in O(n²) time by generating all ordered pairs and checking their sums against potential differences. It uses a hash table to store computed values, allowing efficient lookups to determine if a Pythagorean Quad exists.

$\boxed{\text{O}(n^2)}$

QUESTION: Describe a database to store animal sightings, supporting the following four operations, where n is the number of sightings stored in the database at the time of the operation. State whether your running times are worst-case, expected, and/or amortized. initialize() add_sighting(s, i) remove_oldest() is_common(s) //// ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain the following data structures: • A hash table H mapping each species s to a Set AVL tree T • Each Set AVL Tree T』 stores pairs (i, ci) of zone numbers i and the count ci representing the number of sightings of species s in zone i, keyed by zone number. • Augment each node x in each T, by the maximum number of sightings x.m of any zone in the subtree of x. x.m can be maintained in O(1) time from the augmentations of x's children, specifically x.m = max{x.left.m,x.key,x.right.m}. • A doubly-linked list L of all current sightings (s, i) in the order in which they were added to the database (oldest at the front). To implement initialize(), initialize an empty H and empty L in worst-case O(1) time. To implement add_sighting(s, i), lookup s in H to find T, in expected O(1) time (if s does not exist in H, insert s mapping to an empty T, in expected amortized O(1) time). Then find zone i in Ts. If zone i is not in Ts, insert (i, 1) into Ts. Otherwise, i is in Ts, so remove (i, ci) from Ts and reinsert (i, c₁ + 1). It takes worst-case O(log n) time to remove or insert items from T, while maintaining augmentations (since at most n sightings could exist for species s). Lastly, Insert (s, i) to the back of L in worst-case O(1) time. Thus this operation takes O(log n) expected amortized time, and maintains the invariants of the database directly. To implement remove_oldest (), remove the oldest pair (s, i) from the front of L in worst-case O(1) time. Lookup s in H to find T, in expected O(1) time; then lookup i in Ts and decrease Ci by one. If ci is decreased to zero, remove i from Ts. If Ts becomes empty, remove s from H in expected amortized O(1) time. This operation takes O(log n) expected amortized time, and maintains the invariants of the database directly. To implement is_common(s), simply lookup s in H and return whether s is in H and the stored max at the root of T is 100 or greater in expected O(1) time. This operation is correct based on the invariants of the data structure.
//// ANSWER: 
To implement the database for storing animal sightings with the specified operations, we can use the following approach:

### Data Structures
1. **Hash Table (H)**: A hash table where each key is a species name 's', and the value is an AVL tree containing entries of the form (zone number, count). This allows efficient storage and retrieval of counts per zone for each species.
2. **Linked List (L)**: A doubly linked list to maintain the order of sightings based on their addition date. Each node in the list contains a pair (species 's', zone number 'i').

### Operations

#### 1. Initialize()
- **Action**: Set up an empty hash table H and an empty linked list L.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) since we are simply initializing pointers.

#### 2. Add_sighting(s, i)
- **Steps**:
  1. Append the pair (s, i) to the front of the linked list L.
  2. Check if species 's' exists in H:
     - If not, create a new AVL tree T_s with a root node containing max count 0.
     - If it exists, retrieve the existing AVL tree T_s.
  3. In T_s, find or insert the zone number 'i':
     - If inserting, set the initial count to 1 and update the nodes' max counts as needed.
     - Update each node along the path to ensure their max counts are correctly maintained.
  4. Return the updated linked list L.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log m), where m is the number of zones for species 's'.

#### 3. Remove_oldest()
- **Steps**:
  1. Remove the first element (s, i) from the linked list L.
  2. In T_s, decrement the count for zone 'i':
     - If the count becomes zero, remove the entry from T_s.
     - Update the max counts in T_s to reflect the new maximum after removal or decrementing.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log m), where m is the number of zones for species 's'.

#### 4. Is_common(s)
- **Steps**:
  1. Check if H contains the species 's'.
     - If not, return false.
  2. Retrieve the AVL tree T_s from H.
  3. Check the root node's max count in T_s.
     - If the max count is >= 100, return true; otherwise, return false.

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) since it involves simple hash table lookup and a constant-time check on the root of the AVL tree.

### Summary
The database uses a combination of a hash table for efficient species lookups and an AVL tree with max count augmentation to maintain accurate zone counts. The linked list ensures that sightings are processed in chronological order, allowing for efficient removal of the oldest sighting. Each operation is designed to handle its respective task efficiently, leveraging the strengths of each data structure.

This approach ensures that all operations are performed optimally, providing a robust solution for managing animal sightings data with the specified requirements.

QUESTION: Given a k-even-mixed array A containing n distinct integers for k = [n/lgn], describe an O(n)-time algorithm to sort A. //// ANSWER: Scan through A and put all even integers in order into an array AE and all odd integers in order into an array Ao (where |AE| = k and |Ao| = n k). Ao is sorted by definition, and we can sort AĘ in O(k logk) = O((n/lgn) log(n/lgn)) = O(n) time, e.g., via merge sort. Then we can merge sorted AE and Ao back into A in O(n) time using the merge step of merge sort, using O(n) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm described works as follows:

1. **Partitioning**: Traverse the array A and separate it into two subarrays:
   - AE: Contains all even integers from A.
   - Ao: Contains all odd integers from A.

2. **Sorting AE**: Since |AE| = k (where k = [n / log n]), we can sort AE using merge sort, which takes O(k log k) time. Given that k ≈ n / log n, the sorting step runs in O(n) time because:
   \[
   k \log k = \frac{n}{\log n} \cdot \log\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right) \approx \frac{n}{\log n} \cdot (\log n - \log \log n) = n(1 - o(1)) \in O(n)
   \]

3. **Merging**: The Ao subarray is already sorted by construction, and AE has been sorted in the previous step. We then merge these two sorted arrays into a single sorted array using the standard merge procedure from merge sort, which operates in linear time, O(n).

Thus, combining all steps, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as both sorting and merging are done in linear or near-linear time.

**Answer**: The algorithm sorts A by partitioning it into even (AE) and odd (Ao) integers. AE is sorted with merge sort in O(k log k) = O(n) time, where |AE| = k. Ao is already sorted. Merging these two arrays takes O(n) time, resulting in an overall O(n)-time algorithm.

QUESTION: Let A be an array of n pairs of positive integers (xi, Yi) with Xi, Yi < n² for all i ∈ {0, . . ., n − 1}. The power of pair (x, y) is the integer x + nº. Describe an O(n)-time algorithm to sort the pairs in A increasing by power. //// ANSWER: First note that x < ny for any integer y > 1 and for any x ∈ {0, . . ., n²−1}. Scan through A and put all pairs having y = 1 into array A₁, and all other pairs into array A2. Sort A₁ directly by computing and comparing their respective powers x+n. Since these values are bounded above by O(n²), sort A₁ in O(n) time using Radix sort. To sort A2, use tuple sort, sorting first by x values and then by y values (since power is more sensitive to changes in y). Since the x and y values are both bounded above by O(n²), we can use Radix sort for tuple sort's stable sorting algorithm to sort A2 in O(n) time. Then merge A₁ and A2 back into A in O(n) time using the merge step of merge sort, using O(n) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to compute the "power" for each pair (x, y) using the specified formula and then sort the pairs in ascending order based on their computed power. The formula is as follows:

- If \( y = 1 \), then power = \( (x + y) \times n \)
- Otherwise, power = \( x + y \)

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Formula**:
   - For each pair, check if the second element (\( y \)) is equal to 1.
   - If \( y = 1 \), compute the power as \( (x + y) \times n \).
   - If \( y \neq 1 \), compute the power simply as \( x + y \).

2. **Compute Power for Each Pair**:
   - Apply the formula to each pair in the list.

3. **Sort the Pairs by Power**:
   - Arrange the pairs from the smallest computed power to the largest.

### Example Calculation

Let's consider an example with specific data:

- Pairs: (2, 1), (3, 4), (5, 2)
- Value of \( n \): 10

Compute the power for each pair:
- For (2, 1): Since \( y = 1 \), power = \( (2 + 1) \times 10 = 30 \)
- For (3, 4): Since \( y \neq 1 \), power = \( 3 + 4 = 7 \)
- For (5, 2): Since \( y \neq 1 \), power = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

Sort the pairs based on their computed powers:
- The pairs with power 7 come first: (3, 4) and (5, 2)
- Then the pair with power 30: (2, 1)

### Final Sorted List

\[
\boxed{[(3,\ 4),\ (5,\ 2),\ (2,\ 1)]}
\]

QUESTION: Given an n × m array representing an image, describe an O(nm)-time algorithm to count the number of blobs in the image. //// ANSWER: Construct a graph G with a vertex per white pixel, with an undirected edge between two vertices if the pixels associated with them are both white and share an edge of the grid. This graph has size at most O(nm) vertices and at most O(nm) edges (as pixels share edges with at most four other pixels), so can be constructed in O(nm) time. Each connected component of this graph corresponds to a blob, so run Full-BFS or Full-DFS to count the number of connected components in G in O(nm) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we can model the image as a graph where each node represents a white pixel. Edges are added between nodes if their corresponding pixels share an edge in the grid (i.e., they are adjacent horizontally or vertically). Each connected component in this graph corresponds to a blob.

### Approach
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Create a graph with a vertex for each white pixel.
   - Add undirected edges between vertices if their corresponding pixels are adjacent and both are white.

2. **Connected Components Counting**:
   - Use either BFS or DFS to traverse the graph and count the number of connected components.
   - Each connected component represents a blob in the image.

### Solution Code
```python
def count_blobs(image):
    n = len(image)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    m = len(image[0])
    
    visited = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    def is_white(i, j):
        return image[i][j] == 'white'
    
    def bfs(start_i, start_j):
        queue = deque()
        if not is_white(start_i, start_j):
            return
        visited[start_i][start_j] = True
        queue.append((start_i, start_j))
        
        while queue:
            i, j = queue.popleft()
            for di, dj in directions:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m and not is_white(ni, nj) or visited[ni][nj]:
                    continue
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                queue.append((ni, nj))
    
    blob_count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if is_white(i, j) and not visited[i][j]:
                blob_count += 1
                bfs(i, j)
                
    return blob_count
```

### Explanation
- **Graph Construction**: Each white pixel is a node. Edges are added between adjacent pixels to represent connectivity.
- **BFS/DFS Traversal**: We traverse each unvisited white pixel and mark all reachable pixels as part of the same blob using BFS or DFS, incrementing the blob count each time we start a new traversal.

This approach efficiently counts blobs in O(nm) time by leveraging graph traversal techniques on a grid-based representation.

QUESTION: Given a connected undirected graph G = (V, E) with strictly positive weights w : E → Z+ where |E| = |V|, describe an O(|V|)-time algorithm to determine a path from vertex s to vertex t of minimum weight. //// ANSWER: Given two vertices in a weighted tree containing only positive weight edges, there is a unique simple path between them which is also the minimum weight path. A depth-first search from any source vertex s in the tree results in a directed DFS tree in O(|V|) time (since |E| = |V| – 1). Then relaxing edges in topological sort order of the directed DFS tree computes minimum weight paths from s in O(|V|) time. Since G has one cycle, our strategy will be to break the cycle by removing an edge, and then compute the minimum weight path from s to t in the resultant tree. First, we find the vertex v closest to s on the cycle by running depth-first search from s in O(|V|) time (since |E| = |V|). One edge e₁ of the cycle will not be in the tree returned by DFS (a back edge to v), with the other edge of the cycle incident to v being a single outgoing DFS tree edge 62. If s is on the cycle, v = s; otherwise the unique path from s to v does not contain e1 or e2. A shortest path from s to t cannot traverse both edges e₁ and e2, or else the path would visit v at least twice, traversing a cycle of positive weight. Removing either e1 or e2 results in a tree, at least one of which contains the minimum weight path from s to t. Thus, find the minimum weight path from s to t in each tree using the algorithm described above, returning the minimum of the two in O(|V|) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a path from node `s` to node `t` such that every intermediate node on the path is part of a given set of required nodes. This can be efficiently checked using graph traversal techniques like Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Approach
1. **Input Reading and Initialization**: Read the number of nodes `N` and edges `M`, followed by reading each edge to construct an adjacency list representation of the graph.
2. **Identify Nodes `s` and `t`**: Read the values of `s` and `t`.
3. **Read Required Nodes**: Construct a set `C` containing all required nodes.
4. **Check Connectivity**: If either `s` or `t` is not in the set `C`, print "NO" immediately since no valid path can exist without these nodes.
5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Perform BFS starting from node `s` to explore all reachable nodes within the subset of nodes specified by `C`. If during this traversal we reach node `t`, it means there exists a valid path, and we print "NO". If the BFS completes without reaching `t`, print "YES".

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import deque

def main():
    # Read N and M
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N+1)]  # Nodes are numbered from 1 to N
    
    for _ in range(M):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)
    
    # Read s and t
    s, t = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Read the list of required nodes C
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C_set = set(C)
    
    # Check if s or t is not in C
    if s not in C_set or t not in C_set:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # BFS setup
    visited = [False] * (N + 1)
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(s)
    visited[s] = True
    
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        
        if u == t:
            print("NO")
            return
        
        for v in adj[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                visited[v] = True
                queue.append(v)
    
    # If we exit the loop without returning, check again (in case s is same as t?)
    print("YES" if s == t else "NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Graph Construction**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors.
- **BFS Traversal**: Starting from `s`, BFS explores all reachable nodes within the subset of required nodes. If it reaches `t` during this traversal, we know a valid path exists.
- **Efficiency**: BFS ensures that we explore each node and edge at most once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges.

This approach efficiently checks for the existence of a valid path using graph traversal techniques, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.

QUESTION: Describe an O(nlog n)-time algorithm to find the shortest driving route from the power plant back home that avoids driving within driving distance k of a doughnut shop (or determine no such route exists). //// ANSWER: Construct a graph G with a vertex for each of the n city locations, and an undirected edge between two locations if there is a road connecting them, with each edge weighted by the positive length of its corresponding road. The degree of each vertex is bounded by a constant (i.e., 5), so the number of edges in G is O(n). First, we identify vertices that are within driving distance k of a doughnut shop location: create an auxiliary vertex x with a 0-weight outgoing edge from x to every doughnut shop location, and run Dijkstra from x. Remove every vertex from the graph whose shortest path from x is less than or equal to k, resulting in graph G' ⊂ G. If either p or h are not in G', then no route exists. Otherwise, run Dijkstra from p in G'. If no path exists to h, then no valid route exists. Otherwise, Dijkstra finds a shortest path from p to h, so return it (via parent pointers). This algorithm runs Dijkstra twice. Since the size of either graph is O(|V|), Dijkstra runs in O(|V| log |V|) = O(nlog n) time (e.g. using a binary heap to implement a priority queue).
//// ANSWER: 
The problem involves finding the shortest driving route from a power plant (p) back home (h) without coming within a distance \( k \) of any doughnut shop. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Construct Graph G**: Represent each city as a vertex and connect them with edges if there is a road between them, weighted by the road length.

2. **Identify Forbidden Nodes**:
   - Create an auxiliary vertex \( x \) connected to all doughnut shop locations with zero-weight edges.
   - Run Dijkstra's algorithm from \( x \) to compute the shortest distance of each city from any doughnut shop.

3. **Filter Safe Cities**: Remove cities (vertices) whose shortest path from \( x \) is ≤ \( k \). The remaining graph \( G' \) contains only cities sufficiently far from doughnut shops.

4. **Check Connectivity**:
   - If either p or h are not in \( G' \), no valid route exists.
   - Otherwise, run Dijkstra's algorithm on \( G' \) starting from p to find the shortest path to h.

5. **Result**: The shortest path found in step 4 is the desired route if it exists; otherwise, no such route is possible.

This approach ensures that we avoid forbidden areas efficiently and find the optimal path within the remaining safe zones.

QUESTION: Given directed graph G = (V, E) having arbitrary edge weights w : E → Z and two vertices s, t ∈ V, describe an O(|V|³)-time algorithm to find the minimum weight of any path from s to t containing at least |V| edges. //// ANSWER: Our strategy will compute intermediate values for each vertex v ∈ V: 1. the minimum weight w₁ (v) of any path from s to v using exactly |V| edges, and then 2. the minimum weight w₂(v) of any path from v to t using any number of edges. First, to compute (1), we make a duplicated graph similar to Bellman-Ford, but without edges corresponding to remaining at a vertex. Specifically, construct a graph G₁ with • |V| + 1 vertices for each vertex v ∈ V: vertex vk for k ∈ {0, . . ., |V|} representing reaching v from s along a path containing k edges; and • |V| edges for each edge (u, v) ∈ E: edge (uk−1, Uk) of the same weight for k ∈ {1, ...,|V|}. Now a path in G₁ from so to υν for any v ∈ V corresponds to a path from s to v in G through exactly |V| edges. So solve SSSPs in G₁ from so to compute the minimum weight of paths to each vertex traversing exactly |V| edges. This graph is acyclic, and has size O(|V|(|V| + |E|)) = O(|V|³), so we can solve SSSP on G₁ via DAG relaxation in O(|V|³) time. Second, to compute (2), we make a new graph G2 from G where every edge is reversed. Then every path to t in G corresponds to a path in G2 from t, so compute SSSPs from t in G2 to find the minimum weight of any path from v to t in G using any number of edges, which can be done in O(|V||E|) = O(|V|³) time using Bellman-Ford. Once computed, finding the minimum sum of w₁(v) + w₂(v) over all vertices v ∈ V will provide the minimum weight of any path from s to t containing at least |V| edges, since every such path can be decomposed into its first |V| edges and then the remainder. This loop takes O(|V|) time, so the algorithm runs in O(|V|³) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm involves constructing two modified graphs and using DAG relaxation for shortest path computation:

1. **Construct G₁**: Each vertex is duplicated into layers (v₀, v₁, ..., v|V|). Edges from uk to vk in G correspond to edges in G₁ with shifted indices. This forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each layer represents the number of edges used.

2. **Compute w₁(v)**: Using DAG relaxation on G₁ starting from s (v₀), compute the shortest paths using exactly |V| edges for each vertex v.

3. **Construct G₂**: Reverse all edges in the original graph G to form G₂.

4. **Compute w₂(v)**: Run Bellman-Ford on G₂ starting from t, computing the shortest paths from any vertex v to t with any number of edges.

5. **Combine results**: For each vertex v, calculate the sum of w₁(v) and w₂(v). The minimum value across all v gives the desired path length.

The overall time complexity is O(|V|³), making it efficient for large graphs.

$\boxed{O(V^3)}$

QUESTION: Design a database to help Criminal Seafood maintain its wait list supporting the following operations, each in O(1) time. State whether each operation running time is worst-case, amortized, and/or expected. //// ANSWER: Maintain a doubly-linked list containing customers on the wait list in order, maintaining a pointer to the front of the linked list corresponding to the front of the wait list, and a pointer to the back of the linked list corresponding to the back of the wait list. Also maintain a hash table mapping each customer name to the linked list node containing that customer. To implement $add\_name(x)$, create a new linked list node containing name x and add it to the back of the linked list in worst-case O(1) time. Then add name x to the hash table pointing to the newly created node in amortized expected O(1) time. To implement $remove\_name (x)$, lookup name x in the hash table in and remove the mapped node from the linked list in expected O(1) time. Lastly, to implement $seat ()$, remove the node from the front of the linked list containing name x, remove name x from the hash table, and then return x, in amortized expected O(1) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To design the database for Criminal Seafood's waitlist supporting the operations in O(1) time, we can utilize a combination of data structures:

### Data Structures:
1. **Doubly-Linked List**: This will be used to maintain the order of customers on the waitlist. Each node in the linked list contains a customer name and pointers to the previous and next nodes.
2. **Hash Table**: This will map each customer's name to its corresponding node in the linked list, allowing for O(1) average time complexity for insertions and deletions.

### Operations:

#### 1. `add_name(x)`:
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a new node with the customer's name.
  - Append this node to the end of the linked list.
  - Insert the new node into the hash table, mapping the name to the node.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (worst-case and amortized).

#### 2. `remove_name(x)`:
- **Implementation**:
  - Lookup the customer's name in the hash table to find the corresponding node.
  - Remove the node from the linked list by adjusting the pointers of its previous and next nodes.
  - Remove the entry from the hash table.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (amortized expected).

#### 3. `seat()`:
- **Implementation**:
  - Retrieve the front node using a pointer maintained to always point to the first customer in the linked list.
  - Return the name of the front customer and remove them from both the linked list and the hash table.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (amortized expected).

### Summary:
By combining a doubly-linked list with a hash table, we achieve efficient O(1) time complexity for each operation. The linked list ensures quick insertion and removal at both ends, while the hash table provides fast access to specific customers by name.

This design allows Criminal Seafood to manage their waitlist efficiently, ensuring that each operation is handled in constant time on average.

QUESTION: Describe a database that can store Mether's sensor data and support the following operations, each in worst-case O(log n) time where n is the number of measurements in the database at the time of the operation. //// ANSWER: Maintain a Set AVL tree L storing distinct measurement latitudes, where each latitude l maps to a rainfall Set AVL tree R(l) containing all measurement triples with latitude l, keyed by time. We only store nodes associated with measurements, so the height of each Set AVL tree is bounded by O(log n). For each rainfall tree, augment each node p with the maximum rainfall p.m of any measurement within p's subtree. This augmentation can be maintained in constant time at a node p by taking the maximum of the rainfall at p and the augmented maximums of p's left and right children (if they exist); thus this augmentation can be maintained without effecting the asymptotic running time of standard AVL tree operations. To implement $record\_data (r, l, t)$, search L for latitude l in worst-case O(log n) time. If l does not exist in L, insert a new node corresponding to l mapping to a new empty rainfall Set AVL tree, also in O(log n) time. In either case, insert the measurement triple to R(l), for a total running time of worst-case O(log n). To implement $peak\_rainfall (l,t)$, search L for latitude l in worst-case O(logn) time. If l does not exist, return zero. Otherwise, perform a one-sided range query on R(l) to find the peak rainfall at latitude l since time t. Specifically, let $peak(v, t)$ be the maximum rainfall of any measurement in node v's subtree measured at time > t (or zero if v is not a node): $peak(v, t) = \begin{cases} max \{v.item.r, v.right.m, peak(v.left, t)\} & \text{if } v.t > t \\ peak(v.right, t) & \text{if } v.t < t \end{cases}$ Then peak rainfall is simply peak(v,t) with v being the root of the tree, which can be computed using at most O(log n) recursive calls. So this operation runs in worst-case O(log n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of efficiently recording rainfall measurements and querying the maximum rainfall for a specific latitude after a certain time, we can use an augmented AVL tree structure.

### Approach
1. **Data Structure Selection**: 
   - Use an AVL tree (L) to store distinct measurement latitudes. Each node in this tree represents a unique latitude.
   - For each latitude, maintain another AVL tree (R(l)) that stores all rainfall measurements for that latitude, organized by their timestamps.

2. **Augmented Trees**:
   - Each node in the R(l) trees will store the maximum rainfall value within its subtree. This allows efficient querying of the maximum rainfall after a given time.
   - When inserting a new measurement into R(l), update the max values as necessary to maintain correctness.

3. **Operations**:
   - **record_data(r, l, t)**: Insert the measurement into the appropriate R(l) tree based on latitude and timestamp. Update the max values in each node along the path.
   - **peak_rainfall(l, t)**: Check if L contains the latitude. If not, return 0. Otherwise, traverse R(l) to find the maximum rainfall after time t using the augmented max values.

# Query peak_rainfall for latitude 'B' after time 2025.
print(peak_rainfall('B', 2025))  # Output should be the maximum between 5 (time 2024) and any others in B after 2025, which is 0. So output is max(5,0)=5.

# Query peak_rainfall for latitude 'D' after time 2026.
print(peak_rainfall('D', 2026))  # Output should be 0 since no data exists for D.
```

### Explanation
- **Node Class**: Represents a node in the AVL tree, containing key (latitude), left and right children, and max_val which stores the maximum rainfall value in its subtree.
- **Balance Function**: Returns the height and size of the subtree to maintain balance during rotations.
- **Update Max Function**: Updates the max_val for each node based on its children's values.
- **Insert Function**: Inserts a new node into the tree while maintaining the AVL property and updating max values.
- **Find Max Function**: Finds the maximum value in the subtree that meets the target condition (after time t).
- **Record Data**: Uses the insert function to add rainfall measurements to the appropriate tree.
- **Peak Rainfall**: Queries the tree to find the maximum rainfall for a given latitude after a specified time, using both L and R(l) trees efficiently.

This approach ensures that both insertion and querying operations are performed in O(log n) time due to the properties of AVL trees and augmented data structures.

QUESTION: Given T and P, describe an O(n + m)-time algorithm to return a gameplay of maximum total value. //// ANSWER: To solve this problem, it would be useful to be able to check whether a particular array of at most 10 positive integers is a playable word. Construct an empty hash table D and insert each $p_i$ for $i \in {0, . . ., m – 1}$ into D, mapping to its value $v(p_i)$. Each hash table insertion takes expected constant time (as each $p_i$ has constant size), so constructing D takes expected O(m) time. Now we solve the problem via dynamic programming. 1. Subproblems • x(i): the maximum total value of any gameplay on suffix T[i :] for $i \in {0, . . ., n}$ 2. Relate • Left-most playable word either starts with $t_i$ or it does not • If playable word starts with $t_i$, word may have any length in {1, . . ., 10} (Guess!) • $x(i) = max\{x(i+1)}\cup\{D[T[i : i + j]] + x(i + j)\ 3. Topo • x(i) only depends on subproblems with strictly larger i, so acyclic 4. Base • x(n) = 0 (empty gameplay admits no value) 5. Original • Solve subproblems via recursive top down or iterative bottom up • x(0) is the maximum value of any gameplay on T • Store parent pointers to reconstruct an optimal gameplay 6. Time • # subproblems: n + 1 = O(n) • Work per subproblem: expected O(1) • Together with hash table construction, yields expected O(n + m) time • (See scratch S2 for common mistakes)
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding a gameplay with maximum total value, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with preprocessing. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Construct a hash table \( D \) where each key is a playable word from set \( P \), and the corresponding value is its assigned value. This allows for constant-time look-up to check if a substring exists in \( P \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Define \( x(i) \) as the maximum total value of any gameplay starting at position \( i \) in string \( T \). Here, \( i \) ranges from 0 (start of \( T \)) to \( n \) (end of \( T \)).
   
3. **Recursive Relation**:
   - For each position \( i \), consider all possible playable words that start at \( T[i] \). These words can have lengths ranging from 1 up to a maximum length (e.g., 10, as per the context).
   - If a word of length \( j \) starting at \( i \) exists in \( D \), then \( x(i) \) is updated as:
     \[
     x(i) = \max(x(i), v(p_j) + x(i + j))
     \]
     where \( v(p_j) \) is the value of the word \( p_j \).

4. **Base Case**:
   - When \( i = n \), there are no more characters to process, so \( x(n) = 0 \).

5. **Compute DP Table**:
   - Compute \( x(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0. This ensures that when computing \( x(i) \), the values of \( x(i + j) \) are already known.

6. **Reconstruct Optimal Solution**:
   - Starting from \( x(0) \), backtrack through the DP table to determine which words were selected at each step, reconstructing the optimal gameplay sequence.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Preprocessing**: Constructing hash table \( D \) takes \( O(m) \) time where \( m \) is the size of set \( P \).
  
- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - The number of subproblems is \( O(n) \), as we compute \( x(i) \) for each position from 0 to \( n \).
  - For each subproblem, checking up to a fixed maximum word length (e.g., 10) results in constant time per subproblem.
  
- **Total Time Complexity**: The overall complexity is \( O(n + m) \), making the solution efficient for large inputs.

### Solution Code

```python
def max_value_gameplay():
    # Read input and preprocess P into a hash table D
    from collections import defaultdict
    p = {}
    with open('p.txt', 'r') as f:
        lines = [line.strip() for line in f]
        for line in lines:
            if line:  # skip empty lines
                word = line.split()[0]  # assuming each line has one word
                value = int(line.split()[1])
                p[word] = value

    t = input().strip()
    n = len(t)
    
    # Initialize DP array
    x = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        max_val = 0
        # Check all possible word lengths starting at i
        max_length = min(10, n - i)
        for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
            substring = t[i:i+length]
            if substring in p:
                current_value = p[substring] + x[i + length]
                if current_value > max_val:
                    max_val = current_value
        x[i] = max_val

    # Reconstruct the optimal gameplay
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < n and x[i] != 0:
        for length in range(1, min(10, n - i) + 1):
            substring = t[i:i+length]
            if substring in p and (p[substring] + x[i + length]) == x[i]:
                result.append(substring)
                i += length
                break

    print(' '.join(result))

max_value_gameplay()
```

### Explanation

- **Preprocessing**: The code reads the playable words from a file, constructs a hash table \( D \) to map each word to its value.
  
- **Dynamic Programming Array**: The array `x` is used where `x[i]` represents the maximum value starting at position `i`.

- **Filling DP Table**: For each position `i`, we check all possible substrings of up to length 10. If a substring exists in \( D \), its value plus the subsequent DP value is considered.

- **Reconstruction**: Starting from the beginning, the code backtracks through the DP array to reconstruct the optimal gameplay sequence by selecting words that contribute to the maximum values.

This approach efficiently computes the optimal gameplay with maximum total value using dynamic programming and preprocessing for quick look-up.

QUESTION: Given a target sum m and two disjoint sets A and B, each containing exactly n distinct positive integers, describe an O(nm)-time algorithm to determine whether m is the sum of any limited-unlimited sequence S of A and B, i.e., $m = \sum_{s \in S} s$.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exist subsets from two given arrays such that their sums equal a specified target value. The approach involves generating all possible subset sums for each array and then checking if any combination of these sums equals the target value.

### Approach
1. **Generate Subset Sums**: For each input array, generate all possible subset sums. This can be done using a recursive or iterative method to consider every possible combination of elements in the array.
2. **Check Combinations**: Once we have the set of all subset sums for both arrays, check if there exists any pair of sums (one from each array) that add up to the target value.

### Solution Code
```python
def get_subset_sums(arr):
    subset_sums = {0}
    for num in arr:
        new_sums = set()
        for s in subset_sums:
            new_sum = s + num
            if new_sum not in subset_sums:
                new_sums.add(new_sum)
        subset_sums.update(new_sums)
    return subset_sums

# Read input
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
S = int(input())

setA = get_subset_sums(A)
setB = get_subset_sums(B)

for x in setA:
    if (S - x) in setB:
        print("True")
        exit()

print("False")
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two arrays and a target sum. These are read from standard input.
2. **Generating Subset Sums**: For each array, we generate all possible subset sums using a helper function `get_subset_sums`. This function iteratively builds up the set of sums by considering each element and adding it to existing sums.
3. **Checking for Target Sum**: After generating the subset sums for both arrays, we iterate through each sum from the first array and check if there exists a corresponding sum in the second array such that their combined value equals the target sum.

This approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible combinations of subset sums to find a valid pair that meets the target sum requirement.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n³)-time algorithm to determine whether it is possible to assign the students equally to the three breakout rooms (i.e., n students to each room) while providing strictly positive help to every student, and if possible, return the maximum total benefit to students of any such assignment.
//// ANSWER: 
The number of ways to assign each of three students to one of three rooms with exactly one student per room is calculated using permutations. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. For the first student, there are 3 choices of rooms.
2. For the second student, since one room is already taken, there are 2 remaining choices.
3. For the third student, only 1 choice remains.

Multiplying these together: 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.

$\boxed{6}$
