//// ANSWER: 
To determine the maximum amount of lottery winnings Tiff can win in the next n days by playing the lottery infrequently, we can use an O(n)-time algorithm based on dynamic programming. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Algorithm Overview
The problem involves determining the optimal days for Tiff to play the lottery such that she maximizes her winnings while adhering to a rule that she cannot play more than every 6 days. The approach uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum possible winnings.

### Key Steps

1. **Define Subproblems:**
   - Let `x(i, j)` represent the maximum lottery winnings starting from day `i` to day `n`, assuming Tiff plays on day `i` and the next earliest play is on day `i + j`.
   - Here, `j ∈ {1, 2, ..., 6}` represents the number of days after which she can play again.

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The recurrence relation for `x(i, j)` considers all possible gaps between plays (from 1 to 11 days). For each gap `k`, it updates the maximum winnings based on the next allowable play.
     ```
     x(i, j) = L(i) + max{x(i + k, max{1, 7 - k}) | for k ∈ {j, ..., 11} and i + k ≤ n}
     ```
   - This relation ensures that after playing on day `i`, the next play is optimally chosen to maximize future winnings.

3. **Topological Order:**
   - The subproblems are solved in reverse order starting from day `n` (base case) moving backward to day 1.
   - Each subproblem depends only on days after the current day, ensuring a dependency graph without cycles.

4. **Base Case:**
   - When Tiff reaches the last day (`i = n`), she cannot play again, so:
     ```
     x(n, j) = L(n)
     ```
   - This represents the maximum winnings if she plays on the last day and stops.

5. **Compute Original Problem:**
   - The solution to the original problem is found by evaluating `max{x(1, 1), x(1, 2), ..., x(1, 6)}`.
   - This gives the optimal starting point for her first play followed by subsequent plays based on previous choices.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** The algorithm involves solving `6n` subproblems (for each of `n` days and 6 possible `j` values), with each subproblem computed in constant time. Thus, the overall complexity is linear relative to the number of days.

This approach efficiently computes the optimal strategy for Tiff's lottery play using dynamic programming, ensuring she maximizes her winnings while respecting the play frequency rule.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n^4)-time algorithm to determine whether Charlie is a fraud. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • Let A, B, and C be the relevant length-n DNA sequences from Alice, Bob, and Charlie. • Want to match some characters of A and B to all characters of C. • x(i, j, ki, kj): true if a length-ki subsequence of suffix A[i:] and a length-kj subsequence of prefix B[j:] can match all characters in suffix C[(n − ki − kj):] (the suffix containing the last ki + kj characters), and false otherwise. • Defined for i, j ∈ {0,...,n} and ki, kj ∈ {0,...,n/2} (assume n is even). 2. Relate • Must match character C[i]; if A[i] = C[i] or B[i] = C[i], recurse on remainder. • Alternatively, do not use either A[i] or B[i]. • The recurrence relation: x(i, j, ki, kj) = OR { x(i + 1, j, ki + 1, kj) if A[i] = C[n − ki − kj] and ki > 0, x(i, j + 1, ki, kj + 1) if B[j] = C[n − ki − kj] and kj > 0, x(i + 1, j, ki, kj) if i < n, x(i, j + 1, ki, kj) if j < n } 3. Topo • Subproblem x(i, j, ki, kj) only depends on strictly smaller i + j, so it is acyclic. 4. Base • x(n, n, 0, 0) is true (all matched!). • x(n, j, ki, kj) is false if ki > 0 (no more characters in A). • x(i, n, ki, kj) is false if kj > 0 (no more characters in B). 5. Original • Solve subproblems via recursive top-down or iterative bottom-up approach. • Solution to the original problem is x(n, n, n/2, n/2). 6. Time • Number of subproblems: O(n⁴). • Work per subproblem: O(1). • Overall time complexity: O(n⁴).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine whether Charlie is a fraud using an \(O(n^4)\)-time algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Define Subproblems**: Let \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) be the DNA sequences of Alice, Bob, and Charlie, each of length \(n\). We define a subproblem \(x(i, j, ki, kj)\) as follows:
   - \(i\): Current position in sequence \(A\).
   - \(j\): Current position in sequence \(B\).
   - \(ki\): Number of characters matched from the suffix of \(A\) starting at \(i\).
   - \(kj\): Number of characters matched from the prefix of \(B\) ending at \(j\).

2. **Recurrence Relation**: The function \(x(i, j, ki, kj)\) returns true if:
   - Either \(A[i] = C[n - ki - kj]\) and we can recurse on \(i + 1\), or
   - \(B[j] = C[n - ki - kj]\) and we can recurse on \(j + 1\), or
   - We do not use either \(A[i]\) or \(B[j]\).

3. **Topological Order**: Compute the subproblems in increasing order of \(i + j\) to ensure dependencies are resolved before they're needed.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - \(x(n, n, 0, 0)\) is true (all characters matched).
   - Any state where \(ki > 0\) or \(kj > 0\) after exhausting the respective sequences returns false.

5. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a bottom-up approach to fill a 4-dimensional table based on increasing values of \(i + j\).

6. **Solution Extraction**: The final answer is found in \(x(n, n, n/2, n/2)\), indicating all characters from both Alice and Bob have been matched.

7. **Time Complexity**: With \(O(n^4)\) subproblems each requiring constant time to solve, the overall complexity is \(O(n^4)\).

This algorithm efficiently determines Charlie's fraudulence by leveraging dynamic programming to explore all possible matches between Alice, Bob, and Charlie's sequences within the specified time constraint.

QUESTION: Describe an O(nks)-time algorithm to find the maximum volume of food Obert can eat given his diet. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • x(i, j, s0): maximum volume of food possible when purchasing a suffix of plates pᵢ to pₙ₋₁, using at most j calories and ordering exactly s0 sweet plates. • Defined for i ∈ {0,...,n}, j ∈ {0,...,k}, s0 ∈ {0,...,s}. 2. Relate • Either order plate pᵢ or not. Guess! • If ordering pᵢ, gain vᵢ in volume but use cᵢ calories. • If pᵢ is sweet, must order one fewer sweet plate. • The recurrence relation: x(i, j, s0) = max { x(i + 1, j, s0), vᵢ + x(i + 1, j - cᵢ, s0 - sᵢ) if cᵢ ≤ j and sᵢ ≤ s0 } 3. Topo • Subproblems x(i, j, s0) only depend on strictly larger i, so it is acyclic. 4. Base • x(n, j, 0) = 0 for any j (no more plates to eat). • x(n, j, s0) = −∞ for s0 > 0 and any j (no more plates, but still need to eat sweet). 5. Original • Solution given by x(0, k, s). 6. Time • Number of subproblems: O(nks). • Work per subproblem: O(1). • Overall time complexity: O(nks).
//// ANSWER: 
The solution involves a dynamic programming approach where we define subproblems based on the current plate, remaining calories, and the number of allowed sweet plates used so far. By considering both taking and not taking each plate, we ensure all constraints are respected while maximizing the volume of food consumed.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Subproblems:** 
   - Let `x(i, j, s0)` represent the maximum volume achievable starting from plate `i` with `j` calories remaining and having used `s0` sweet plates so far.
   
2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For each plate `i`, decide whether to take it or not:
     - If taking plate `i`, check if its calorie cost is within the limit (`c_i <= j`) and that using this plate doesn't exceed the allowed sweet plates (`s_i <= s0`). The volume increases by `v_i` and, if the plate is sweet, reduce the remaining allowed sweet plates by 1.
     - If not taking plate `i`, carry forward the maximum volume from the next plate.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - When all plates are considered (`i = n`), no more food can be taken, so `x(n, j, s0) = 0`.
   - If any state exceeds calorie or sweet plate limits, it's impossible to achieve that state, hence set to `-infinity`.

4. **Compute States:**
   - Iterate through each plate from the end towards the start, filling in all possible states based on the recurrence relation.

5. **Result Extraction:**
   - The maximum volume is found at `x(0, k, s)`, representing the optimal solution starting with full calorie and sweet plate limits.

**Answer:**

The algorithm uses dynamic programming with a 3D table of size O(nks), where each state transition considers taking or not taking the current plate. This results in an overall time complexity of O(nks). The maximum volume is found at `x(0, k, s)`, ensuring all constraints are met.

\boxed{O(nks)}

QUESTION: Given the price lists of in-game purchases and ride sharing trips between all pairs of monsters, describe an O(n²)-time algorithm to determine the minimum amount of money Kash must spend in order to catch all n monsters, assuming that she starts at the location of monster m₁. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • x(i, j): minimum cost of catching monsters mᵢ to mₙ, starting at location mⱼ for j ≤ i. 2. Relate • If already at the location of monster mᵢ, catch it for free! • Otherwise, acquire monster mᵢ either by purchasing or ride-sharing to its location. Guess! • If purchasing, spend cᵢ dollars; otherwise, ride-share from mⱼ to mᵢ. • The recurrence relation: x(i, j) = min { x(i + 1, j) if j = i, cᵢ + x(i + 1, j), s(j, i) + x(i, i) } 3. Topo • Subproblems x(i, j) only depend on strictly larger i + j, so it is acyclic. 4. Base • x(n + 1, j) = 0 for any j (no cost when no monsters are left to catch). 5. Original • Solution given by x(1, 1). 6. Time • Number of subproblems: O(n²). • Work per subproblem: O(1). • Overall time complexity: O(n²).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the minimum amount of money Kash must spend to catch all \( n \) monsters starting at monster \( m_1 \), we can use a dynamic programming approach with an \( O(n^2) \)-time algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### 1. Define Subproblems
We define \( x(i, j) \) as the minimum cost to catch all monsters from \( m_i \) to \( m_n \), starting at location \( m_j \).

### 2. Recurrence Relation
The recurrence relation is based on two choices:
- **Buying the current monster**: If Kash is not already at \( m_i \), she can buy it for cost \( c_i \) and then catch all remaining monsters from \( m_{i+1} \) starting at \( m_j \).
- **Ride-sharing to the current monster**: She can ride-share to \( m_i \) for cost \( s(j, i) \) and then start catching from \( m_i \) onwards.

The recurrence relation is:
\[
x(i, j) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } i > n \\
\min\left( c_i + x(i+1, j), s(j, i) + x(i, i) \right) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### 3. Base Case
When all monsters have been caught (\( i = n+1 \)), the cost is zero:
\[
x(n+1, j) = 0 \quad \text{for any } j.
\]

### 4. Computation Order
Compute \( x(i, j) \) for decreasing values of \( i \) (from \( n \) down to 1) and all possible \( j \) from 1 to \( i \). This ensures that when computing \( x(i, j) \), the subproblems \( x(i+1, j) \) and \( x(i, i) \) have already been solved.

### 5. Time Complexity
There are \( O(n^2) \) subproblems (one for each pair \( (i, j) \)), and each subproblem is solved in constant time. Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).

### 6. Result
The minimum cost starting at \( m_1 \) is given by \( x(1, 1) \), which provides the optimal strategy for catching all monsters with minimal expenditure.

This approach efficiently captures the optimal decisions between buying and ride-sharing, ensuring that Kash spends the least amount of money to catch all monsters.

QUESTION: Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E, w) with positive and negative edge weights, and given a particular vertex v ∈ V, describe an O(k|E|)-time algorithm to return the minimum weight of any cycle containing vertex v that also has exactly k edges, or return that no such cycle exists. Recall that a cycle may repeat vertices/edges. //// ANSWER: Assume all vertices in G are reachable from v so that |V| = O(|E|); otherwise, run BFS or DFS to solve single source reachability from v, and replace G with the subgraph reachable from v in O(|E|) time. Construct a new graph G' = (V', E') with:• k + 1 vertices for each vertex v ∈ V: specifically vᵢ for all i ∈ {0, . . ., k}; and• k edges for each edge (u, v) ∈ E: specifically edges (uᵢ₋₁, vᵢ) for all i ∈ {1, ...,k}.Graph G' has (k + 1)|V| = O(k|E|) vertices and k|E| edges in k + 1 layers, and has the property that paths from v₀ to vₖ have a one-to-one correspondence with cycles through v in G of the same weight containing exactly k edges, since exactly one edge is traversed with each increase in layer. So solve SSSP from v₀ in G' to return the minimum weight path to vₖ. Since edges in G' always increase in subscript, G' is a DAG, so we can solve SSSP using DAG relaxation in linear time with respect to the size of G'. So together with initial pruning, this algorithm takes O(k|E|) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the minimum weight cycle containing vertex \( v \) with exactly \( k \) edges in a weighted directed graph \( G = (V, E, w) \), we can use the following approach:

### Approach
1. **Construct an Auxiliary Graph (\( G' \))**:
   - For each vertex \( u \in V \), create \( k + 1 \) copies of \( u \), denoted as \( u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_k \).
   - For each edge \( (u, v) \in E \), add \( k \) directed edges in \( G' \):
     - From \( u_i \) to \( v_{i+1} \) with the same weight as \( (u, v) \).

2. **Transform the Problem**:
   - The problem of finding a cycle through \( v \) with exactly \( k \) edges in \( G \) is transformed into finding the shortest path from \( v_0 \) to \( v_k \) in \( G' \). This is because each step in \( G' \) corresponds to moving along an edge in \( G \), and a path of length \( k \) in \( G' \) represents a cycle of \( k \) edges in \( G \).

3. **Shortest Path Algorithm**:
   - Since \( G' \) is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) due to the layered structure, we can use the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA), which efficiently handles DAGs and provides an optimal solution even with negative edge weights.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The number of vertices in \( G' \) is \( O(k|E|) \).
   - The number of edges in \( G' \) is also \( O(k|E|) \).
   - SPFA runs in linear time relative to the number of edges, making the overall complexity \( O(k|E|) \).

### Solution Code
```python
import heapq

def find_min_cycle_weight(G_prime, k):
    # G_prime is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of (neighbor, weight)
    n = len(G_prime)
    INF = float('inf')
    
    dist = {node: INF for node in G_prime}
    source = f'v_0'
    target = f'v_{k}'
    dist[source] = 0
    
    # Use a queue to process nodes
    queue = [source]
    while queue:
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        if current_node == target:
            return dist[current_node]
        for neighbor, weight in G_prime.get(current_node, []):
            if dist[neighbor] > dist[current_node] + weight:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[current_node] + weight
                # If we've found a shorter path to the target, add it to the queue
                if neighbor == target and dist[target] < dist[neighbor]:
                    continue  # To avoid adding multiple times
    
    return INF

# Example usage:
# G_prime is constructed as per the method above with k=2.
# min_weight = find_min_cycle_weight(G_prime, 2)
```

### Explanation
- **Graph Construction**: Each vertex in \( G \) is split into \( k + 1 \) layers, creating a new graph where each layer represents being at that vertex after taking a certain number of steps. This ensures that any path from the source (vertex \( v \) at step 0) to the target (vertex \( v \) at step \( k \)) must consist of exactly \( k \) edges.
- **SPFA Utilization**: By leveraging SPFA, we efficiently find the shortest path in a DAG. This algorithm is chosen because it handles negative weights and provides an optimal solution without getting stuck in cycles.
- **Complexity Consideration**: The transformation into \( G' \) ensures that each step corresponds to moving through edges of \( G \), maintaining the problem's constraints while allowing us to use efficient shortest path algorithms.

This approach effectively reduces the problem to finding a specific type of shortest path, ensuring both correctness and efficiency.

QUESTION: Given a 3-color labeling c : E → {red, green, blue} of a connected, weighted, undirected graph G = (V, E, w) containing only positive edge weights, and given two vertices s,t ∈ V, describe an efficient algorithm to return a path from s to t having minimum color cost. //// ANSWER: Construct a new graph G' = (V', E') with:• 3 vertices for each vertex v ∈ V: specifically vᵢ for i ∈ {red, green, blue} corresponding to arriving at vertex v via an edge with color i;• (vertex-edges) 3 undirected edges for each vertex v ∈ V: specifically {vred, vblue}, {vgreen, vred}, and {vblue, vgreen} of weight wc; and• (edge-edges) 1 undirected edge for each undirected edge {u,v} ∈ E of weight w and color c(u, v): specifically undirected edge {uc(u,v), vc(u,v)} with weight w.Graph G' has 3|V| vertices and 3|V| + |E| edges, and has the property that the minimum weight of any path in G' from any vertex sᵢ to any vertex tⱼ for i, j ∈ {red, green, blue} is equal to the minimum color cost of any 3-color labeled path in G from s to t, as switching colors at a vertex requires traversing an edge of weight w. So solve SSSP three times, once from each vertex sᵢ and find the minimum weight of any path to any tⱼ, and then return a minimum path by constructing parent pointers as shown in lecture. Since this graph only has positive edge weights, we can solve SSSP using Dijkstra in O(|V| + |E| + |V|log |V|) = O(|E| + |V|log|V|) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine whether you can drive from node \( S \) to node \( T \) without getting stuck due to the road signs, we model the problem using a two-state graph where each node has states representing the last road's color (Red or Green). Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Modeling the Graph:**
   - Each original node is split into two nodes: one for being in state Red (\( R \)) and another for being in state Green (\( G \)).
   - For each edge from \( u \) to \( v \):
     - If the edge color is Red, add edges from both \( u_R \) and \( u_G \) to \( v_R \).
     - If the edge color is Green, add edges from both \( u_R \) and \( u_G \) to \( v_G \).

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Start BFS from both initial states: \( S_R \) and \( S_G \).
   - Track visited nodes in each state to avoid cycles.
   - If during BFS, we reach either \( T_R \) or \( T_G \), then it is possible to drive without getting stuck.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - If either \( T_R \) or \( T_G \) is reachable from the initial states, output that you can drive successfully.
   - Otherwise, output that it's not possible.

This approach ensures we consider all possible color sequences and determine if a path exists without getting stuck.

\boxed{\text{You can drive from } S \text{ to } T \text{ without getting stuck.}}

QUESTION: Ranger Raargorn needs to deliver a message from her home town of Tina's Mirth to the town of Riverdell, but the towns of Midgard have been overrun by an army of k Orks. Raargorn has a map of the n towns and 3n roads in Midgard, where each road connects a pair of towns in both directions. Scouts have determined the number of Orks rᵢ ≥ 1 stationed in each town i (there is at least one Ork stationed in each town). Describe an O(k)-time algorithm to find a path from Tina's Mirth to Riverdell on which Raargorn will encounter the fewest total Orks in towns along the way. //// ANSWER: Construct a graph G = (V, E) with:• a chain of rᵢ vertices (v₁, ..., vᵣᵢ) connected by rᵥ – 1 edges for each town v, i.e., unweighted directed edge (vᵢ, vᵢ₊₁) for all i ∈ {1, . . ., rᵥ − 1}; and• two unweighted directed edges (vᵣᵥ, u₁) and (vᵣᵥ, u₁) for each road between towns u and v.Graph G has ∑ rᵥ = k vertices and 2(3n) + ∑(rᵥ − 1) = 5n + k edges. Since there is at least one Ork in each town, k ≥ n, so G has size O(k). Let s and t correspond to the towns of Tina's Mirth and Riverdell respectively. Graph G has the property that any path from s₁ to tᵣ₁ corresponds to a path from Tina's Mirth to Riverdell crossing edges equal to the number of Orks encounters in towns along the way, since for any road connecting towns u and v, going from u₁ to v₁ requires traversing rᵥ edges in G. So solve unweighted SSSP from s₁ to tᵣ₁ using BFS in O(k) time, and return the sequence of towns visited along the found shortest path by following parent pointers.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem efficiently, we can model the towns and their connections using a graph where each town is split into multiple nodes based on the number of Orks present. This allows us to represent the traversal through each town as steps in the graph, ensuring that the shortest path corresponds to the minimum sum of Orks encountered.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - For each town with `r` Orks, create `r` nodes representing each Ork.
   - Connect these nodes in a chain within the town, such that moving from one node to the next represents encountering an additional Ork.
   - For each bidirectional road between two towns, add directed edges in both directions between the last node of the source town and the first node of the destination town.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Use BFS starting from the initial town's node to find the shortest path to the destination town.
   - The number of steps taken in this traversal corresponds directly to the sum of Orks encountered along the way, as each step through a town's nodes represents moving past one more Ork.

3. **Result Extraction:**
   - The length of the shortest path found by BFS gives the minimum number of Orks encountered when traveling from the initial town to the destination.

**Answer:**  
The solution involves constructing an expanded graph where each town is split into multiple nodes, and using BFS to find the shortest path in terms of steps. This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the path with the least sum of Orks, operating within O(k) time complexity due to the linear number of edges relative to the total Orks.

$\boxed{O(k)}$

QUESTION: Given a cycle-sparse graph, describe an O(|V|³)-time algorithm to return the number of negative-weight cycles in G. //// ANSWER: Construct a new graph G' by adding a supernode x to G with a zero-weight directed edge (x, v) for each v ∈ V. Then run SSSP from x in G' using Bellman-Ford to label each vertex v ∈ V with its shortest path distance δ(x, v). For each v ∈ V, δ(x,v) = −∞ if and only if v is reachable from a negative-weight cycle in G (since adding x does not add or remove any cycles). Further, for any directed edge (u, v), if δ(x, u) = δ(x,v) = -∞, then both u and v are each reachable from the same simple negative-weight cycle (since v is reachable from u and each vertex is reachable from at most one simple negative-weight cycle).So, construct a new graph G" on only the vertices v ∈ V where δ(x,v) = −∞ in G', with an undirected edge between u and v in G" if they share a directed edge in G. Graph G" has the property that the number of connected components in G" equals the number of negative-weight cycles in G, so count and return the number of connected components in G" using Full-BFS or Full-DFS. This algorithm takes O(|V|+|E|) time to construct G', O(|V||E|) time to run Bellman-Ford, O(|V|+|E|) time to construct G", and then O(|V|+|E|) time to count connected components in G", leading to an O(|V||E|) = O(|V|³) running time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the number of negative-weight cycles in a graph \( G \), we can follow this algorithm:

1. **Construct a New Graph \( G' \):**
   - Add a supernode \( x \) to \( G \).
   - For each vertex \( v \in V \), add a directed edge from \( x \) to \( v \) with weight 0.

2. **Run Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**
   - Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm starting from node \( x \) in graph \( G' \).
   - For each vertex \( v \in V \), if the shortest path distance \( \delta(x, v) = -\infty \), it indicates that \( v \) is reachable from a negative-weight cycle in \( G \).

3. **Construct Graph \( G'' \):**
   - Create a new graph \( G'' \) using only those vertices \( v \) where \( \delta(x, v) = -\infty \).
   - For each directed edge \( (u, v) \) in \( G \), if both \( u \) and \( v \) are present in \( G'' \), add an undirected edge between them.

4. **Count Connected Components:**
   - The number of connected components in \( G'' \) corresponds to the number of negative-weight cycles in \( G \).

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- Constructing \( G' \) takes \( O(|V|) \).
- Bellman-Ford runs in \( O(|V||E|) \), which is feasible for cycle-sparse graphs.
- Constructing \( G'' \) and counting connected components each take linear time, resulting in an overall complexity of \( O(|V|^3) \).

This approach efficiently identifies all negative-weight cycles by leveraging the properties of Bellman-Ford and graph connectivity.

QUESTION: Assuming she departs s at half capacity, [b/2], describe an O(nlogn)-time algorithm to determine the maximum amount of energy Bellham can have in her battery upon reaching t. //// ANSWER: Construct graph G with a vertex for each of the n locations in Norway and a directed edge for each of the O(n) roads: specifically for each road from location u to v, add directed edge (u, v) weighted by J(u,v). Then [b/2] minus the weight of a minimum-weight path from s to t in G would correspond to the maximum energy Bellham could have upon reaching t; or at least it would be if she did not either exceed or exhaust her tank along the way.First we show that every minimum-weight path from s to t in G is simple. It suffices to show that every directed cycle in G has positive weight. Consider cycle (c₀, ..., cₖ₋₁, cₖ = c₀). C has weight ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ J(cᵢ₋₁, cᵢ) > ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ mg(h(cᵢ) - h(cᵢ₋₁)) = 0, as desired.Any simple path in G traverses at most n - 1 edges, so the magnitude of its weight is at most (n - 1)k < b/2. Thus [b/2] minus the weight of any simple path in G will always be > 0 and < b (so Bellham cannot exhaust or exceed her tank by driving on a simple path from s to t).Lastly, we find the weight of a minimum-weight path from s to t by solving SSSP. Unfortunately using Bellman-Ford takes O(n²) time which is too slow. However, we can re-weight edges in G to be positive while preserving shortest paths by exploiting the provided vertex potentials, similar to Johnson's algorithm. Specifically, create new graph G', identical to G, except change the weight of each edge (u, v) to J(u, v) – mg(h(v) – h(u)) > 0. This transformation preserves shortest paths since the weight of each path from, e.g., a to b changes by the same amount, namely by mg(h(b) – h(a)). So run Dijkstra from s to find the minimum weight D of any path to t in G', and return [b/2] – (D – mg(h(b) – h(a))).Constructing G takes O(n) time, reweighting to G' also takes O(n) time, and then running Dijkstra from s in G' takes O(n log n) time, leading to O(n log n) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the maximum amount of energy Bellham can have upon reaching location \( t \) without exceeding her tank capacity or running it empty, follow these steps:

1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**:
   - Construct a directed graph \( G \) where each vertex represents a location in Norway and each edge represents a road from one location to another.
   - Assign weights to the edges based on the energy consumption \( J(u, v) \) for traveling from location \( u \) to \( v \).

2. **Ensure Feasible Paths**:
   - Recognize that any simple path (without cycles) from \( s \) to \( t \) will have a weight sum less than \( b/2 \), ensuring Bellham never exceeds her tank capacity or runs out of battery.

3. **Find the Minimum-Weight Path**:
   - Use Johnson's algorithm with Dijkstra's method on the reweighted graph \( G' \) where each edge weight is adjusted to ensure positivity while preserving shortest paths.
   - This involves creating a new graph \( G' \) by subtracting \( mg(h(v) - h(u)) \) from each original edge weight, ensuring all weights are positive.

4. **Calculate Remaining Energy**:
   - Compute the minimum energy required for any path from \( s \) to \( t \) using Dijkstra's algorithm on \( G' \).
   - Subtract this minimal energy cost from \( b/2 \) to find Bellham's maximum remaining energy upon reaching \( t \).

This approach ensures that Bellham arrives at \( t \) with the maximum possible energy without exceeding her tank capacity or running out of battery mid-journey.

**Answer**:  
By constructing a graph \( G \), reweighting it using Johnson's method to ensure positivity, and applying Dijkstra's algorithm on the transformed graph \( G' \), we find the minimum energy path from \( s \) to \( t \). Subtracting this minimal energy from \( b/2 \) gives Bellham the maximum remaining energy. Thus, the solution is an O(n log n)-time algorithm.

\boxed{O(n \log n)}

QUESTION: For each function, state its worst-case running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n²)
//// ANSWER: 
The question asks about the worst-case running times in terms of n and k for each function. The provided answer states an O(n²) time complexity, which typically applies to algorithms with nested loops or those performing operations on every pair of elements within a dataset. However, without specific functions mentioned, this is a general response applicable to common scenarios like bubble sort or checking all pairwise comparisons.

Answer: Without specific functions mentioned, the provided answer of O(n²) is correct for several common worst-case scenarios involving two nested loops or all pairwise operations on n elements.

QUESTION: For each function, state its expected running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n)
//// ANSWER: 
The expected running times of the functions in terms of \( n \) and \( k \) depend on the specific behavior of each function. Without detailed information about each function, it's challenging to definitively determine their time complexities.

1. **If a function processes elements linearly with respect to \( n \)**: The expected running time is likely \( O(n) \), especially if \( k \) does not significantly impact the operations beyond constants.

2. **If both parameters \( n \) and \( k \) influence the operations**: The time complexity might be more complex, such as \( O(n + k) \) or \( O(kn) \).

3. **For functions similar to quicksort**: The average-case running time is typically \( O(n \log n) \), not just \( O(n) \).

In summary, if each function's expected running time simplifies to a linear dependency on \( n \) regardless of \( k \), then yes, their expected running times are \( O(n) \). Otherwise, the complexity might involve both parameters.

QUESTION: For each function, state its worst-case running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n + k)
//// ANSWER: 
The functions described have their worst-case running times determined by adding the complexities of two separate operations: one dependent on \( n \) and another on \( k \). This results in a combined time complexity of \( O(n + k) \).

**Answer:**
Each function has a worst-case running time of \( O(n + k) \), where \( n \) represents the size of an array or similar structure, and \( k \) is another variable that affects the operations performed. This occurs when two independent operations are executed sequentially, each with their own respective complexities (\( O(n) \) and \( O(k) \)), leading to a total complexity of \( O(n + k) \).

QUESTION: For each function, state its expected running times in terms of n and k. //// ANSWER: O(n + k)
//// ANSWER: 
The expected running time of a function being O(n + k) indicates that the algorithm's performance depends on two independent parameters, n and k. Here are some scenarios where this complexity is typical:

1. **Linear Search with Target at Position k**: If searching through an array of size n and finding the target at position k (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n), the worst-case time is O(n). However, if you have to process each element up to k, it could be O(k). But in cases where both n and k are independent, their sum determines the complexity.

2. **Processing Two Separate Arrays**: If a function processes two arrays of sizes n and k independently (e.g., sorting or searching each), the total time is O(n + k).

3. **Traversal of Two Lists**: When traversing two linked lists with lengths n and k separately, the total operations are O(n + k).

4. **Two Independent Operations**: If a function performs one operation on an array of size n and another on an array of size k without overlapping, their combined time is O(n + k).

In each case, the running time combines both parameters linearly, resulting in O(n + k). This complexity arises when two separate processes are performed independently, each with its own linear dependency.

QUESTION: State which item(s) in the array could have the key with the smallest integer //// ANSWER: A
//// ANSWER: 
The item(s) with the smallest integer key depend on the specific keys present in the array. If the keys are positive integers starting from 0, the first item (key 0) has the smallest integer key.

**Answer: A**

QUESTION: State which item(s) in the array could have the key with the third smallest integer //// ANSWER: B, C, D, E, F, G
//// ANSWER: 
The problem requires identifying the third smallest "key" across multiple items. Assuming that keys refer to individual elements within each item:

1. List all elements from each item:
   - Item 1: [10, 20]
   - Item 2: [30, 40, 50]
   - Item 3: [60, 70]
   - Item 4: [80, 90, 100]

2. Combine all elements into a single list:
   - [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

3. Sort the combined list in ascending order.

4. Identify the third smallest element.

The third smallest key is **30**.

$\boxed{30}$

QUESTION: State which item(s) in the array could have the key with the largest integer //// ANSWER: F, G, H, I, J
//// ANSWER: 
The items F, G, H, I, and J have the largest integer values among all elements in the array.

**Answer:** F, G, H, I, J

QUESTION: State the array representation of H, first before and then after performing the operation H.delete_max(). //// ANSWER: Before: [93, 85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17] After: [85, 63, 38, 23, 17, 11, 13]
//// ANSWER: 
The initial array before deletion is [93, 85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]. After deleting the maximum element (93), the array becomes:

Before: [93, 85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]  
After delete_max(): [85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]

The user's provided after array is incorrect as it skips elements. The correct after array should start with the next highest element (85) followed by the remaining elements in their original order.

Answer:  
Before: [93, 85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]  
After delete_max(): [85, 38, 23, 63, 11, 13, 17]

QUESTION: Perform operation S.delete_at(3) on S including any rotations, and then list the items stored in the leaves of s in traversal order, after the operation has completed. //// ANSWER: (17,85, 11, 13)
//// ANSWER: 
The result of performing S.delete_at(3) and listing the items in the leaves after traversal would be:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding B-tree Structure**: A B-tree is a self-balancing tree with multiple keys per node, maintaining sorted order.

2. **Operation S.delete_at(3)**: This removes the third element from the sorted list of leaf nodes.

3. **Example Scenario**: Assume initial leaves have elements [5], [8], and [3]. Deleting position 3 (element 8) results in restructuring.

4. **Post-Deletion Structure**: After deletion, the tree may adjust through rotations or node merges to maintain balance.

5. **Resulting Leaves**: The traversal order after adjustments is (17,85,11,13).

**Answer:** (17, 85, 11, 13)

QUESTION: For House Puffle Huff, students must be sorted by friend number, i.e., how many of the other n 1 incoming students they are friends with, which can be determined in O(1) time. //// ANSWER: Friend numbers are non-negative integers less than n, so we can use counting sort to sort the students in worst-case O(n) time. (Radix sort also works with the same running time.) Since we have to compute friend number for each student, any algorithm will take at least Ω(n) time, so this is optimal.
//// ANSWER: 
The optimal sorting method for House Puffle Huff's students based on friend numbers is as follows:

1. **Friend Numbers Range**: Each student's friend number ranges from 0 to n-1.

2. **Sorting Algorithm Choice**:
   - **Counting Sort**: Suitable because it operates in O(n + k) time, where k (max value of friend numbers) equals n. Thus, the complexity is O(n).
   - **Radix Sort**: Also applicable with a time complexity of O(n), as each friend number can be treated as a single digit.

3. **Optimality**:
   - The lower bound for any algorithm to compute and sort these values is Ω(n) since each student's friend number must be determined.
   - Both counting sort and radix sort achieve this optimal time complexity, making them the best choices.

In conclusion, using either counting sort or radix sort provides an efficient O(n) solution, which is optimal for sorting students by their friend numbers in House Puffle Huff.

QUESTION: For House Craven Law, students must be sorted by the weight of their books. Book weights cannot be measured precisely, but the Sorting Sock has a scale that can determine in O(1) time whether one set of books has total weight greater than, less than, or equal to another set of books. //// ANSWER: A scale weighing is a comparison with a constant number of outcomes, so the comparison sort Ω(nlogn) lower bound applies. So we cannot do better than by using an worst-case O(nlogn) sorting algorithm, e.g., merge sort, using the scale to compare one student's books against another's.
//// ANSWER: 
House Craven Law must use a sorting algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of Ω(n log n) due to the nature of their Sorting Sock. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding the Tool**: The Sorting Sock provides comparisons in constant time (O(1)), allowing them to determine if one set of books is heavier, lighter, or equal to another.

2. **Comparison Sorts Lower Bound**: Any comparison-based sorting algorithm has a lower bound of Ω(n log n). This means that regardless of the efficiency of individual comparisons, the number of comparisons needed grows at least logarithmically with the number of elements (students).

3. **Applicability of Merge Sort or QuickSort**: Since these algorithms are optimal for comparison sorts and have an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), they can be effectively used here.

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, House Craven Law cannot achieve a sorting algorithm with a better than Ω(n log n) time complexity using the Sorting Sock tool.

Answer: Yes, any worst-case optimal comparison sort like merge sort would have an O(n log n) time complexity, which is the best they can do.

QUESTION: For House Driven Gore, students must be sorted by bravery, which can't be directly measured or quantified, but for any set of students, the Sorting Sock can determine the bravest among them in O(1) time, e.g., by presenting the students with a scary situation. //// ANSWER: We can't quantify bravery, so we can't hope to use any integer-based algorithms. However, the Sorting Sock can find a student of maximum bravery in O(1) time, so we repeatedly find and select a bravest student among all previously unselected students in worst-case O(n) time, which is again optimal. (This is priority queue sort, using the Sorting Sock as the priority queue to find the maximum.)
//// ANSWER: 
The process of sorting students based on their bravery using the Sorting Sock can be efficiently achieved with an O(n) worst-case time complexity. Here's a structured explanation:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Bravery cannot be directly measured or quantified, so numerical algorithms are inapplicable.

2. **Sorting Sock Functionality**: The Sorting Sock allows finding the student with maximum bravery in O(1) time for any set of students.

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - **Priority Queue Analogy**: Using the Sorting Sock repeatedly to select the max element each time is akin to using a priority queue.
   - **Efficiency**: Each selection (finding and removing the max) takes O(1) time, leading to an overall O(n) complexity when selecting all students.

4. **Handling Ties**: The problem assumes unique bravery levels for simplicity, though ties may require additional handling based on specific requirements.

5. **Feasibility**: The process is efficient as each step maintains a constant time complexity regardless of the number of students.

**Conclusion**: Using the Sorting Sock to iteratively select the max element allows sorting students by bravery in O(n) worst-case time, making it an optimal solution for this scenario.

QUESTION: For House Leather Skin, students must be sorted by their magical lineage: how many of a student's ancestors within the previous 3[log n] + 4 generations were magical. Recall that humans, magical or not, always have two parents in the previous generation, unlike binary tree nodes which have at most one. Assume the Sorting Sock can compute the magical lineage of a student in O(1) time. //// ANSWER: Each student has at most 2k ancestors in the kth generation preceding. Thus the number of wizard ancestors will be a non-negative number bounded above by 3 3 [log n]+4 2k < 23(logn+1)+5 = 2823 logn = 28n3log2 = O(n) for any c > 3 log 2. Thus we can use radix sort to sort the students by their magical lineage in worst-case O(n) time, which is again optimal.
//// ANSWER: 
The House Leather Skin sorting method uses the Sorting Sock to determine each student's magical lineage by counting how many ancestors, within the previous 3 log n +4 generations, were magical. Each generation can have twice as many ancestors as the previous one due to humans having two parents.

To sort the students:
1. **Calculate Magical Ancestors**: For each student, count their magical ancestors up to 3 log n +4 generations back.
2. **Determine Maximum Count (M)**: The maximum number of magical ancestors is bounded by a function that grows polynomially with n, making it feasible for sorting algorithms like radix sort.
3. **Radix Sort Application**: Represent each student's count in fixed bits. Since M can be represented within a reasonable bit length, radix sort operates efficiently in O(n) time.

**Conclusion**: Yes, the students can be sorted using the Sorting Sock and radix sort in optimal O(n) time because their magical lineage counts fit into manageable bit representations.

QUESTION: Given three arrays A, B, C, each containing n integers, give an O(n²)-time algorithm to find whether some a ∈ A, some b ∈ B, and some c∈ C have zero sum, i.e., a + b + c = 0. State whether your running time is worst-case, expected, and/or amortized. //// ANSWER: For each pair of numbers (a, b) ∈ A × B, store a + b in a hash table H. Then return Yes if -c appears in H for any c ∈ C, and return No otherwise. Correctness: If any -c appears in H for any c∈ C, then –C a' + b' for some (a', b') ∈ A × B so a' + b + c = 0. Otherwise, there is no c∈ C for which -c = a' + b' for any (a', b') ∈ A × B. Running Time: There are O(n²) pairs in A × B, so inserting them into H takes expected O(n²) time. Then checking whether each -c appears in H takes expected O(1) time each, and expected O(n) in total. So this algorithm runs in expected O(n²) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Precompute Sums**: Iterate through each element in arrays A and B, compute their sums (a + b), and store these sums in a hash table H.

2. **Check for Zero Sum**: For each element c in array C, check if -c exists in the hash table H. If such an entry is found, return "Yes". If no such entry exists after checking all elements in C, return "No".

**Correctness**:
- The algorithm correctly identifies whether there exist a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C such that a + b + c = 0 by leveraging the precomputed sums of pairs from A and B.

**Time Complexity**:
- Precomputing all possible sums takes O(n²) time.
- Checking each element in C against H is O(n), making the total expected running time O(n²).

Thus, this approach efficiently solves the problem within the desired time complexity.

QUESTION: Given a Sequence AVL Tree T containing n nodes, and a pointer to a node v from T, describe an O(log n)-time algorithm to return the (zero-indexed) index i of node v in the traversal order of T. //// ANSWER: Our algorithm will be to walk up the tree from v to the root r of the Sequence AVL Tree, counting the nodes preceding v in the traversal order along the way, since the number of nodes preceding v in the tree is equivalent to v's (zero-indexed) index. Let #v(u) be the number of vertices preceding v in a vertex u's subtree, where v is in the subtree of u. Then #v(v) = v.left.size if v has a left child and zero otherwise; and can be computed in O(1) time. Then, for every ancestor of u starting from v, we compute #v(u.parent) from #(u). There are two cases: • Case 1, u is the left child of u.parent: then all the nodes preceding v in the subtree of u.parent are in the subtree of u, so set #v(u.parent) = #(u). • Case 2, u is the right child of u.parent: then all nodes in the left subtree of u.parent precede v (as does u), so set #v(u.parent) = 1+u.parent.left.size + #v(u). Then return #v(r), since this is the number of nodes preceding v in r's subtree (i.e., the entire tree). Correctness is argued within the algorithm description. This algorithm spends worst-case O(1) work for each ancestor of v, so since the Sequence AVL Tree is balanced, the number of ancestors is bounded by O(log n), and the algorithm runs in worst-case O(log n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of a specific node in a binary tree when traversed using a pre-order traversal. Pre-order traversal visits nodes by visiting the current node first, then recursively visiting the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

### Approach
The approach involves using an iterative method with a stack data structure to simulate the recursion inherent in pre-order traversal. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize Stack**: Start with the root node as the initial element on the stack.
2. **Iterative Traversal**: Use a loop to process each node from the stack:
   - Pop the top node from the stack and increment the count (this represents moving one level deeper in the tree).
   - Check if this node is the target node; if so, return the current count as its position.
   - Push the right child of the current node onto the stack first, followed by the left child. This ensures that when we pop nodes from the stack next, they are processed in the correct pre-order sequence.

This method efficiently traverses the tree iteratively without recursion, ensuring we handle each node exactly once and maintaining an optimal time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Solution Code
```python
def find_node_position(root, target):
    stack = [root]
    count = 0
    while stack:
        current = stack.pop()
        count += 1
        if current == target:
            return count
        # Push right child first to ensure left is processed next
        if 'right' in current and current['right'] is not None:
            stack.append(current['right'])
        if 'left' in current and current['left'] is not None:
            stack.append(current['left'])
    return -1  # Target node not found in the tree
```

### Explanation
- **Stack Initialization**: The root node is pushed onto the stack to start the traversal.
- **Processing Nodes**: Each iteration pops a node from the stack, increments the count, and checks if it matches the target. If not, its right and left children are pushed onto the stack in reverse order (right first), ensuring they are processed correctly next time.
- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures each node is visited exactly once, making it efficient with a linear time complexity relative to the number of nodes.

This method effectively leverages an iterative depth-first search using a stack to maintain the correct traversal order and efficiently find the position of the target node.

QUESTION: Describe a database supporting the following operations, where k is the number of recorded but unpatched holes in the network at the time of the operation. //// ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain the following data structures: • A Set AVL tree Tp for each pipe p containing all the unpatched holes in p keyed by hole distance • A Hash Table D mapping each pipe p to its tree Tp • A Binary Min Heap Q containing each consecutive pair of holes (p, d1, d2) appearing on the same pipe p with key being the distance |d2 – d₁| between them, and any lonely holes (p, d) (holes that are alone on their pipes) with key ∞ (when multiple stored items have the same key, we store them in a Hash Table keyed by (p, d1, d2) or (p, d)) • A Hash Table C mapping each consecutive hole pair (p, d1, d2) or lonely hole (p, d), to their location in Q.
//// ANSWER: 
The described database design efficiently manages network holes using a combination of data structures to handle various operations. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Data Structures Employed**:
   - **Set AVL Tree (Tp)**: For each pipe p, an AVL tree stores unpatched holes sorted by distance. This ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations in O(log n) time.
   - **Hash Table D**: Maps each pipe p to its corresponding AVL tree Tp, enabling quick access to the tree for specific pipes.
   - **Binary Min Heap Q**: Stores consecutive hole pairs (p, d1, d2) and lonely holes (p, d). The heap prioritizes processing based on the smallest distance first, using a key of infinity for lonely holes.
   - **Hash Table C**: Maps each item in Q to its position within the heap, facilitating quick access during processing.

2. **Operations and Efficiency**:
   - **Insertions**: Adding a hole to Tp is O(log n), maintaining order efficiently.
   - **Heap Management**: Insertions into the min-heap are handled with log n time complexity, ensuring efficient priority-based processing.
   - **Hash Tables**: Provide constant average time complexity for look-ups, enhancing quick access and updates.

3. **Handling Unpatched Holes (k)**:
   - The count k is maintained by tracking unpatched holes across all relevant Tp trees. Each operation adjusts this count as necessary.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Pipes with no holes are handled by empty Tp trees.
   - Single-hole pipes use lonely holes with a key of infinity, ensuring they are processed appropriately.

5. **Scalability and Consistency**:
   - The design ensures atomicity and consistency across operations, crucial for reliable network management.

This setup efficiently balances storage, retrieval, and processing, making it suitable for managing network holes in an scalable manner.

QUESTION: Describe a database supporting the following worst-case operations: //// ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain a single Set AVL Tree T containing each user ID and their status, keyed by ID. In additional, augment each node x in T with four subtree properties: • x.size: the number of IDs in the subtree (as discussed in lecture). • x.suffix = (d, m): the smallest ID d in the subtree for which each of the m IDs d' ≥ d in the subtree is active, or None. Computable in O(1) time as either the suffix (dr, MR) of the right subtree, or if MR is equal to the size of the right subtree and × is active, return the suffix (dL, ML) of the left subtree but add MR + 1 to M₁ (or (x.key, MR + 1) if left suffix is None). • x.prefix = (d, m): the largest ID d in the subtree for which each of the m IDs d' ≤ d in the subtree is active, or None. Computable in O(1) time as either the prefix (d₁, ML) of the right subtree, or if m₁ is equal to the size of the left subtree and × is active, return the prefix (dR, MR) of the right subtree but add ML+1 to MR (or (x.key, m₁+1) if right prefix is None). • x.substring = (a,b,m): a, b are IDs from the subtree where each of the m IDs d in the subtree with a ≤ d ≤ b is active and m is maximized. Computable in O(1) time by tak- ing the max of the substring within either left or right subtree, or the substring spanning the two subtrees if x is active. Specifically, consider the substrings of left and right subtrees, (AL, BL, ML) and (ar, bR, MR) respectively, and then if x is active, consider the suffix of the left subtree (d₁, m'₁) and the prefix of the right subtree (dR, M'R). Then depending on which of (m₁, m'₁ + 1 + M'R, MR) is the largest, return (a₁, bŁ, M₁), (d₁, dR, M'₁ + 1 + m'₨), or (AR, BR, MR) respectively.
//// ANSWER: 
To implement a database supporting the specified operations using an AVL tree with augmented properties, follow these steps:

1. **Data Structure**: Use an AVL tree where each node contains:
   - A user ID as the key.
   - Additional properties: `size`, `suffix` (d, m), and `prefix` (d, m).

2. **Augmented Properties**:
   - **Size**: Represents the number of active IDs in the subtree rooted at the node.
   - **Suffix (d, m)**: Indicates the smallest ID d such that all IDs from d to some maximum are active, with m being the count.
   - **Prefix (d, m)**: Indicates the largest ID d such that all IDs down to some minimum are active, with m being the count.

3. **Operations**:
   - **Insertion and Deletion**: These operations require updating the `size`, `suffix`, and `prefix` properties of each affected node.
   - **Suffix Calculation**: For a node x, its suffix is derived from either its right child's suffix (if all IDs in the right subtree are active) or its left child's suffix adjusted by one if not fully active.
   - **Prefix Calculation**: Similar to suffix but considers the maximum ID with consecutive active IDs down to some minimum.

4. **Substring Property**:
   - Represents the longest range [a, b] of consecutive active IDs within a specified range. It is computed by evaluating both left and right subtrees and considering if the node itself bridges two ranges (from left suffix and right prefix).

5. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Each modification affects nodes along the path from the modified leaf to the root, ensuring properties are recalculated in O(log n) time due to AVL tree balance.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - When all IDs are active or only one ID is active, suffix, prefix, and substring properties adjust accordingly to reflect this state.

By carefully managing these properties during insertions, deletions, and rotations, the database efficiently supports the required operations with worst-case performance optimized by AVL tree balance.

   - For two functions \( f(\eta) \) and \( g(\eta) \), \( f(\eta) \in \Theta(g(\eta)) \) means there exist positive constants \( c_1, c_2 \), and an integer \( n_0 \) such that for all \( \eta \geq n_0 \):
     \[
     c_1 \cdot g(\eta) \leq f(\eta) \leq c_2 \cdot g(\eta)
     \]
   
2. **Simplifying the Functions:**
   - Given:
     \[
     f(\eta) = 2^{2\eta} = (2^{\eta})^2 = 4^\eta
     \]
     \[
     g(\eta) = 2^\eta
     \]
   
3. **Comparing Growth Rates:**
   - \( f(\eta) = 4^\eta \) grows exponentially faster than \( g(\eta) = 2^\eta \).

4. **Evaluating the Lower Bound (\( c_1 \cdot g(\eta) \leq f(\eta) \)):**
   - Substituting:
     \[
     c_1 \cdot 2^\eta \leq 4^\eta
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     c_1 \leq 2^\eta
     \]
   - As \( \eta \) increases, \( 2^\eta \) becomes very large. No constant \( c_1 \) can satisfy this for all sufficiently large \( \eta \).

5. **Evaluating the Upper Bound (\( f(\eta) \leq c_2 \cdot g(\eta) \)):**
   - Substituting:
     \[
     4^\eta \leq c_2 \cdot 2^\eta
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     2^\eta \leq c_2
     \]
   - As \( \eta \) increases, \( 2^\eta \) grows without bound. No constant \( c_2 \) can satisfy this for all sufficiently large \( \eta \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since there are no constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) that satisfy the inequalities for all \( \eta \geq n_0 \), \( 4^\eta \notin \Theta(2^\eta) \).
   
Therefore, the original statement is false.

QUESTION: If T(n) = 2T (n) + n² and T(1) = Θ(1), then T(n) = O(n²). //// ANSWER: False. This is an example of Case II of Master Theorem, since a = 1, b = 3, f(n) = n² and n² = O(nlog3/29/4 log n). Thus, the recurrence evaluates to T(n) = O(n² log n), which is not O(n²).
//// ANSWER: 
The given recurrence relation is \( T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) + n^2 \).

To determine its asymptotic complexity using the Master Theorem:

1. **Identify Parameters**:
   - \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \)
   - \( f(n) = n^2 \)

2. **Compute \( \log_b a \)**:
   - \( \log_3 2 \approx 0.6309 \)

3. **Compare \( f(n) \) with \( n^{\log_b a} \)**:
   - Since \( n^2 \) grows faster than \( n^{0.6309} \), \( f(n) \) is asymptotically larger.

4. **Apply Case III of the Master Theorem**:
   - Check if \( af\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) \leq kf(n) \) for some constant \( k < 1 \).
   - Compute: \( 2\left(\frac{n}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2n^2}{9} \approx 0.222n^2 \)
   - Since \( 0.222n^2 \leq kn^2 \) for any \( k > 0.222 \), the regularity condition holds.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, by Case III of the Master Theorem, \( T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) = \Theta(n^2) \).

The user's conclusion that \( T(n) = O(n^2 \log n) \) is incorrect because it incorrectly applied Case II instead of recognizing that \( f(n) \) falls under Case III due to being polynomially larger than \( n^{\log_b a} \).

**Final Answer:** The time complexity is Theta(n²), so the correct asymptotic bound is \boxed{O(n^2)}.

QUESTION: Performing an O(1) amortized operation n times on an initially empty data structure takes worst-case O(n) time. //// ANSWER: True. This is the definition of amortization.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. Performing n O(1) amortized operations on an initially empty data structure results in a total worst-case time of O(n). This aligns with the definition of amortization, where each operation's cost averages out to constant time over a sequence, leading to linear complexity when scaled by the number of operations.

**Answer:**  
True. The amortized analysis shows that n O(1) operations result in an overall worst-case O(n) time.

QUESTION: Given an array A containing n comparable items, sort A using merge sort. While sorting, each item in A is compared with O(log n) other items of A. //// ANSWER: False. As a counter example, during the final merge step between two sorted halves of the array, each of size O(n), a single item from one array may get compared to all the items from the other list.
//// ANSWER: 
The average number of comparisons an individual element undergoes during a Merge Sort is \( \boxed{\log_2 N} \), where \( N \) is the total number of elements in the array.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Merge Sort:** Merge Sort works by recursively dividing an array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging them back together in a sorted manner.

2. **Merge Process Comparisons:** During the merge step, every element from both subarrays is compared with another element until all elements are placed in order. This comparison happens once per level of recursion for each element involved.

3. **Levels of Recursion:** The number of levels or recursive steps in Merge Sort is \( \log_2 N \) because each split halves the array size, and this continues until individual elements are considered as subarrays of length 1.

4. **Comparisons per Element:** At each level of recursion (merge step), each element is compared once with another element from the other subarray to determine its position in the merged array. Thus, an element participates in one comparison at each merge level.

5. **Total Comparisons for One Element:** Since there are \( \log_2 N \) levels, each element undergoes \( \log_2 N \) comparisons during the entire Merge Sort process.

6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, on average, each individual element will be involved in approximately \( \log_2 N \) comparisons to achieve the sorted order of the array using Merge Sort.

QUESTION: Given a binary min-heap storing n items with comparable keys, one can build a Set AVL Tree containing the same items using O(n) comparisons. //// ANSWER: False. If such an algorithm A existed, we would be able to sort an array of comparable items in O(n) time, which would contradict the Ω(n log n) comparison sort lower bound. Specifically, we could build a binary min-heap from the array using O(n) comparisons, use A to construct a Set AVL Tree in O(n) comparisons, and then return its traversal order.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is false. Here's why:

1. **Lower Bound on Sorting**: Any comparison-based sorting algorithm must take at least Ω(n log n) time due to established lower bounds.

2. **Constructing an AVL Tree**: Building an AVL tree from a set of n elements involves inserting each element, which takes O(log n) per insertion (since the height is logarithmic). Thus, for n elements, this step is O(n log n).

3. **In-Order Traversal**: After constructing the AVL tree, performing an in-order traversal to sort the elements takes O(n) time.

4. **Total Complexity**: The overall complexity of sorting using an AVL tree would be O(n log n), which aligns with the known lower bound but does not contradict it because this is still within the Ω(n log n) requirement.

5. **Conclusion**: Since any algorithm that sorts in less than O(n log n) time contradicts the proven lower bound, such an algorithm A (for building the AVL tree in O(n) comparisons) cannot exist.

**Answer:** False. If such an algorithm existed, it would allow sorting in O(n) time, which is impossible due to the Ω(n log n) comparison sort lower bound.

QUESTION: Given a directed graph G = (V, E), run breadth-first search from a vertex s ∈ V. While processing a vertex u, if some v ∈ Adj+(u) has already been processed, then G contains a directed cycle. //// ANSWER: False. BFS can't be used to find directed cycles. A counterexample is V = {s, a, b,t} and E = {(s, t), (s, a), (a, b), (b, t)}. Running BFS from s will first process vertices in levels {s}, then {a, t}, then {b}. When processing vertex b, vertex t ∈ Adj+(b) has already been processed, yet G is a DAG.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement that BFS cannot be used to detect directed cycles is correct. Here's why:

1. **BFS and Cycle Detection**: BFS is not inherently designed to detect cycles, especially in directed graphs. It can indicate potential cycles through back edges, but these may not always form actual cycles.

2. **Example Analysis**: In the provided example, BFS processes nodes s, a, b, t without detecting an actual cycle. When processing node b, it finds that t has already been processed. However, since all edges are directed and point forward (e.g., from b to t), this does not form a cycle.

3. **Conclusion**: While BFS may encounter back edges in directed graphs, these do not necessarily indicate cycles because the graph could still be acyclic if the direction of traversal prevents loops.

**Answer:** No, BFS cannot reliably detect directed cycles because it might find nodes that have been processed without forming an actual cycle due to edge directions.

QUESTION: Run Bellman-Ford on a weighted graph G = (V, E, w) from a vertex s ∈ V. If there is a witness v ∈ V, i.e., δινι(ς,υ) < διν−1(s, v), then v is on a negative- weight cycle of G. //// ANSWER: False. A witness is only guaranteed to be reachable from a negative- weight cycle; it may not actually be on a negative-weight cycle.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is false. A vertex \( v \) being a witness (i.e., its distance can still be improved after \( n-1 \) relaxations in Bellman-Ford) indicates that \( v \) is reachable from a negative-weight cycle, but it does not necessarily mean that \( v \) itself lies on the cycle. 

**Answer:** False. A witness vertex \( v \) may only be reachable from a negative-weight cycle and need not lie directly on it.

QUESTION: Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's Algorithm solve all-pairs shortest paths in the same asymptotic running time when applied to weighted complete graphs, i.e., graphs where every vertex has an edge to every other vertex. //// ANSWER: True. A complete graph is dense, i.e., |E| = Θ(|V|²), so Johnson's algorithm runs in O(|V|² log |V| + |V||E|) = O(|V|³) time, which is the same as Floyd-Warshall.
//// ANSWER: 
The answer is True. Both Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's Algorithm run in O(V³) time when applied to a weighted complete graph.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**
   - Uses dynamic programming with three nested loops over all pairs of vertices.
   - Time Complexity: O(n³), where n is the number of vertices.

2. **Johnson's Algorithm:**
   - Consists of two main steps:
     1. **SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm):** Runs in O(m) time, which for a complete graph with V vertices and E = Θ(V²) edges becomes O(V²).
     2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Run once for each vertex as the source.
        - Each run of Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with V vertices and E edges has a time complexity of O(m + n log n). For our complete graph, this is O(V² + V log V) per run.
   - Since there are V sources (one for each vertex), the total time becomes V*(V² + V log V) = O(V³ + V² log V).
   - The dominant term here is V³, so Johnson's Algorithm has a time complexity of O(V³).

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both algorithms have an asymptotic running time of O(n³), making their performance comparable for complete graphs.

**Conclusion:** Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's Algorithm both run in the same asymptotic time when applied to weighted complete graphs, which is O(V³).

QUESTION: If there is an algorithm to solve 0-1 Knapsack in polynomial time, then there is also an algorithm to solve Subset Sum in polynomial time. //// ANSWER: True. Subset Sum is the special case of 0-1 Knapsack. Specifically, one can (in linear time) convert an instance (A, T) of Subset Sum into an equiv- alent instance of 0-1 Knapsack, with an item i for each integer aż ∈ A having size si = ai and value v₁ = ai, needing to fill a knapsack of size T; and then solve the instance via the polynomial-time algorithm for 0-1 Knapsack.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is indeed **True**. Here's why:

Subset Sum can be transformed into an instance of the 0-1 Knapsack problem by creating items where each item's weight and value are equal to the corresponding element in the subset sum problem. Solving this transformed knapsack problem with a capacity equal to the target sum will determine if such a subset exists.

If there were a polynomial-time algorithm for solving 0-1 Knapsack, it could be used to solve Subset Sum in polynomial time as well through this reduction. However, both problems are NP-hard, meaning no known polynomial-time algorithms exist unless P=NP. Thus, the statement holds under the assumption that such an algorithm exists.

Answer: True

QUESTION: Suppose a decision problem A has a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm to solve A. If P ≠ NP, then A is not solvable in polynomial time. //// ANSWER: False. A problem could have a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm and a polynomial-time algorithm. In fact, any polynomial-time algorithm is also a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm!
//// ANSWER: 
The answer is **False**. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Terms**: 
   - A **pseudopolynomial-time algorithm** runs in time that is polynomial in the numeric value of the input but not necessarily its size.
   - If a problem has both a pseudopolynomial and a standard polynomial algorithm, it means the problem can be solved efficiently under different conditions.

2. **Implications of P≠NP**: 
   - Assuming P ≠ NP implies there are problems in NP that do not have polynomial-time solutions.
   - However, this does not preclude the existence of a pseudopolynomial algorithm for specific instances or certain types of inputs.

3. **Coexistence of Algorithms**:
   - A problem can indeed have both types of algorithms: one pseudopolynomial and another standard polynomial.
   - For example, some problems might be solved efficiently with dynamic programming (pseudopolynomial) but also with a different approach that yields a true polynomial-time solution.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The initial statement is false because the existence of a pseudopolynomial algorithm does not exclude the possibility of having a standard polynomial algorithm for the same problem, even under the assumption that P ≠ NP.

Thus, the answer is False; both types of algorithms can coexist for certain problems.

QUESTION: Given a connected undirected weighted graph G = (V, E, w), where every edge has a unique integer weight, describe an O(|E|log |E|)-time algorithm to determine the largest value of k such that Gk is not connected. //// ANSWER: Construct an array A containing the |E| distinct edge weights in G, and sort it in O(|E|log |E|) time, e.g., using merge sort. We will binary search to find k. Specifically, consider an edge weight k' in A (initially the median edge weight), and run a reachability algorithm (e.g., Full-BFS or Full-DFS) to compute the reachability of an arbitrary vertex x ∈ V in O(|E|) time. If exactly V vertices are reachable from x, then Ge is connected and k > k'; recurse on strictly larger values for k'. Otherwise, Gk is not connected, so k ≤ k'; recurse on non-strictly smaller values for k'. By dividing the search range by a constant fraction at each step (i.e., by always choosing the median index weight of the unsearched space), binary search will terminate after O(log |E|) steps, identifying the largest value of k such that Gk is not connected. This algorithm takes O(|E|log |E|) time to sort, and computes reachability of a vertex in O(|E|) time, O(log |E|) times, so this algorithm runs in O(|E| log |E|) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the largest value \( k \) such that \( G_k \) is not connected in a connected undirected weighted graph with unique integer edge weights, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Edges**: Begin by sorting all edges of the graph based on their weights in ascending order.

2. **Binary Search for Threshold \( k \)**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the range of possible edge weights (from the smallest to the largest).
   - Perform binary search within this range to find the maximum weight \( k' \) such that when all edges with weight ≤ \( k' \) are included, the graph is still disconnected.

3. **Connectivity Check**:
   - For each midpoint in the binary search (a candidate \( k' \)), construct a subgraph using all edges up to and including those with weight \( k' \).
   - Use BFS or DFS to check if this subgraph is connected.
   - If the graph is disconnected, adjust `low` to explore higher weights. If it's connected, adjust `high` to find potentially lower values.

4. **Determine Maximum Disconnected \( k \)**:
   - The process continues until the binary search converges on the largest \( k' \) where the subgraph remains disconnected.
   - This value of \( k' \) is the desired maximum \( k \).

**Time Complexity Analysis**:
- Sorting edges takes \( O(E \log E) \).
- Each connectivity check via BFS/DFS runs in \( O(V + E) \), which simplifies to \( O(E) \) since \( V \leq E + 1 \).
- Binary search performs \( O(\log E) \) such checks.
- Total time complexity is \( O(E \log E) \).

By following this approach, you efficiently find the largest \( k \) where \( G_k \) remains disconnected.

QUESTION: Describe an O(nd)-time algorithm to determine whether it is possible for Dal and Sean to drive from Yew Nork to Fan Sancrisco in at most d days, spending at most b on expenses along the way. //// ANSWER: Let C = {Co, . . ., Cn-1}, and let cs denote Yew Nork and let ct denote Fan Sancrisco. Construct a graph G with: • a vertex (ci, d') for each city c₁ ∈ C and day d' ∈ {0, . . ., d}, representing staying the night in city c₁ on the night before day d'; and • a directed weighted edge ((ci, d'), (cj, d' + 1)) with weight g(ci, Cj) + h(cj) for each city ci ∈ C, cj ∈ Li and d' ∈ {0, . . ., d – 1}. Then the weight of any path in G from vertex (cs,0) to any vertex (ct, d') for d' ∈ {0,...,d} corresponds to the expenses incurred along a driving route from Yew Nork to Fan Sancrisco in at most d days (assuming they stay the night upon reaching ct; other assumptions are also okay). G is acyclic, since each edge always connects a vertex from a smaller day to a larger day, so run DAG Relaxation to compute single-source shortest paths from (cs, 0) in G. Then return whether d((cs, 0), (Ct, d')) ≤ b for any d' ∈ {0,...d}. G has O(nd) vertices and O(nd) edges (since |Li| ≤ 10 for all i∈ {0,...,n – 1}), so DAG relaxation runs in O(nd) time and checking all destination values takes O(d) time, leading to O(nd) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine whether Dal and Sean can drive from Yew Nork to Fan Sancrisco within at most \( d \) days with expenses not exceeding \( b \), we can use an algorithm based on graph theory and dynamic programming.

### Algorithm Description:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each vertex represents being in a city \( c_i \) on day \( d' \). This is denoted as \( (c_i, d') \).
   - Each edge from \( (c_i, d') \) to \( (c_j, d'+1) \) has a weight equal to the gas cost from \( c_i \) to \( c_j \) plus the hotel cost for staying in \( c_j \).

2. **DAG Relaxation**:
   - Use the DAG relaxation technique to compute the shortest path from Yew Nork (denoted as \( cs \)) on day 0 to all other vertices.
   - This step runs in \( O(nd) \) time, where \( n \) is the number of cities and \( d \) is the maximum allowed days.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - After computing the shortest paths, check if any path ending at Fan Sancrisco (denoted as \( ct \)) has a total cost ≤ \( b \).
   - If such a path exists for any day \( d' \) from 0 to \( d \), return true; otherwise, return false.

### Conclusion:

The algorithm efficiently determines the feasibility of the trip within the given constraints by leveraging graph theory and dynamic programming techniques. The overall time complexity is \( O(nd) \), making it suitable for large inputs where \( n \) and \( d \) are manageable.

QUESTION: Given G, c, a red vertex s ∈ Vr, and a blue vertex t ∈ V♭, describe an O(|V|)-time algorithm to compute d(s, t), the minimum weight of any path from s to t. //// ANSWER: Any path from s to t is a path through edges in Er, followed by a path through edges in Eg, followed by a (possibly empty) path through edges in Eb. So we compute minimum weight distances in G incrementally, first using edges in Er, then using edges in Eg, then edges in Eb. Step 1: Construct unweighted graph G' = (V', E') composed of the edges E' = Er and the vertices appearing in those edges, specifically V' = U(u,v)∈E, {u, v} (which contains vertices from V and Vg). Run breadth-first search from s in G' to compute unweighted distances. Then the minimum weight distance in G from s to any green vertex in V' ∩ V, is wr times the unweighted distance computed. G' has size O(|V|), so this step takes O(|V|) time. Step 2: Now construct weighted graph G" = (V", E") composed of vertex s with a new directed edge to each green vertex in V' ∩ V, weighted by its distance found in Step 1 (i.e., the minimum weight of any path from s to that vertex), along with weighted edges Eg and the vertices appearing in those edges. All the weights in G" are positive, so run Dijkstra from s in G" to compute minimum weight distances. Then the computed distance to any blue vertex v in V" ∩ V is the minimum weight of any path from s to v in G that traverses only red or green edges. G" has size O(1 + |Vg| + |Eg|) = O(|V|0.99), so this step takes O(|V|0.99 log |V|0.99) = O(|V|) time. Step 3: Now construct a weighted graph G''' = (V''', E''') composed of vertex s with a new directed edge to each blue vertex in V" ∩ V weighted by its distance found in Step 2 (i.e., the minimum weight of any path from s to that vertex), along with weighted edges E♭ and the vertices appearing in those edges. Weights in G'' may be positive or negative, so run Bellman-Ford from s in G'' to compute weighted minimum weight distances. Then the computed distance to t is the minimum weight of any path from s to t in G, as desired. G'' has size O(1 + |V6| + |E6|) = O(√VI), so this step takes O(√[V]√[V]) = 0(|V|) time, leading to O(|V|) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem, we'll break it down into three phases based on the edge types provided:

1. **Phase 1: Unweighted BFS using Er edges**
   - Perform an unweighted BFS starting from vertex `s` using only Er edges to find all reachable vertices in this layer (red and green).
   - Record the shortest distances (`d1`) for each vertex reached.

2. **Phase 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm using Eg edges**
   - Use Dijkstra's algorithm on the subgraph consisting of Eg edges, starting from the green vertices reached in Phase 1.
   - Update the shortest paths considering non-negative weights provided by Eg edges to reach other vertices (green or blue).
   - Record these distances as `d2`.

3. **Phase 3: Bellman-Ford using Eb edges**
   - Apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the subgraph of Eb edges, starting from the blue vertices reached in Phase 2.
   - This allows handling any negative weights in Eb edges to find potentially shorter paths to vertex `t`.
   - Record these final distances as `d3`.

The shortest path to `t` is determined by taking the minimum value between `d1[t]`, `d2[t]`, and `d3[t]`.

**Answer:**

The solution involves three phases:

1. **BFS for Unweighted Edges (Er):**
   - Use BFS starting from vertex `s` using only Er edges to find all reachable vertices.
   - Record distances in `d1`.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm for Non-Negative Weights (Eg):**
   - Apply Dijkstra's algorithm on Eg edges, starting from the green vertices reached via `d1`.
   - Update distances in `d2` considering non-negative weights.

3. **Bellman-Ford for Potentially Negative Weights (Eb):**
   - Use Bellman-Ford on Eb edges to potentially shorten paths further.
   - Record final distances in `d3`.

The shortest path length is the minimum of `d1[t]`, `d2[t]`, and `d3[t]`. The answer is:

$\boxed{\min(d_1[t], d_2[t], d_3[t])}$

QUESTION: Describe an O(n²m)-time algorithm to count the number of (m, k)-separated subsets of S. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • First sort the integers in S increasing into array A in O(n log n) time, e.g., via merge sort • where A = (ao,..., an-1) • x(i, j): the number of (j, k)-separated subsets of suffix A[i :] • for i ∈ {0, . . ., n} and j ∈ {0, ...,m} 2. Relate • Sum the number of (j, k)-separated subsets using A[i] with the ones that do not use A[i] • If A[i] < j is used: – Then no integer in A[i :] smaller than A[i] + k may be used – Let f (i) be the smallest index greater than i such that A[f(i)] – A[i] ≥ k – Then recrusively count x(f(i), j – A[i]) • Otherwise, A[i] is not used and we can recursively count x(i + 1, j) Σ{ x(f(i), j - A[i]) if A[i] < j, x(i + 1, j) always } 3.

//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to select `m` elements from a sorted list such that each pair of consecutive elements has a difference of at least `k`, we can use dynamic programming. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the given array in ascending order.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Define a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to select `j` elements from the subarray starting at index `i`.
3. **Base Cases**:
   - If we need zero elements (`j=0`), there is exactly one way (the empty subset).
   - If we are beyond the end of the array and still need some elements, it's impossible.
4. **Transition**: For each position `i` and count `j`, compute the number of ways by considering two cases:
   - Including the current element at index `i`: Move to the next valid position where the difference is at least `k`.
   - Excluding the current element: Continue without using it.
5. **Efficiency**: Use binary search to quickly find the next valid position after including an element, reducing the time complexity.

### Solution Code
```python
def count_subsets(S, m, k):
    S.sort()
    n = len(S)
    
    # Create a DP table with (n+1) rows and (m+1) columns
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case: selecting 0 elements is always possible
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            # Find the first index where S[f] >= S[i] + k
            low = i + 1
            high = n - 1
            f = n  # default to beyond end
            while low <= high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if S[mid] >= S[i] + k:
                    f = mid
                    high = mid - 1
                else:
                    low = mid + 1
            
            # Case 1: include S[i], then look from f with j-1 elements left
            if i < n and (f <= n):
                dp[i][j] += dp[f][j - 1]
            
            # Case 2: exclude S[i], look from i+1 with j elements left
            if i + 1 <= n:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i + 1][j]
    
    return dp[0][m]

# Example usage:
S = [1, 3, 5]
m = 2
k = 2
print(count_subsets(S, m, k))  # Output: 3
```

### Explanation
- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to ensure that we can efficiently find the next valid element using binary search.
- **DP Table Initialization**: We initialize a table where each entry `dp[i][j]` starts at zero. The base case for selecting zero elements is set to 1 since there's exactly one way (the empty subset).
- **Filling DP Table**: For each index from the end of the array backwards, we compute the number of ways to select `j` elements by considering both including and excluding the current element.
- **Binary Search**: To find the next valid position efficiently after including an element, binary search is used, reducing the time complexity.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid subsets while maintaining a manageable time complexity.

QUESTION: Given Ted's guest information, describe an O(n³)-time algorithm to determine a respectful seating order that minimizes the sum of mutual hatred between pairs of guests seated next to each other. //// ANSWER: 1. Subproblems • Sort the guests increasing by favor in O(n log n) time into F = (fo, ..., f2n-1) • Any partition of F into two length-n subsequences corresponds to a respectful seating • x(i, JL, JR, N₁): minimum total hatred of adjacent guests possible by respectfully seating the n i guests from suffix F[i:] next to the Queen, with n₁ guests to the left and NR = (n - i) - n₁ guests to the right, where guest j₁ < i has already been seated n₁ +1 places to the left, and guest jR < i has already been seated NR + 1 places to the right. • for i∈ {0, . . ., 2n}, JL, JR ∈ {−1, ..., 2n − 1} and n₁ ∈ {0,...,n} where either j₁ = i − 1 or j₨ = i − 1 • Let d(−1,i) = d(i, −1) = 0 for all i ∈ {0, . . ., 2n – 1} (no hatred at the end of table) 2. Relate • Guess whether guest i is seated on the right or left • Sitting next to j₁ costs hatred d(i, j₁); sitting next to JR costs hatred d(i, jr) x(i, JL, JR, NL) =min d(i, j₁) + x(i + 1, i, jR, NL − 1) if n₁ > 0, d(i, jr) + x(i + 1, jŁ, i, n₁) if (n - i) - n₁ > 0 3. Topo: Subproblem x(i, JL, JR, NL) only depends on strictly larger i, so acyclic 4. Base: x(2n, JL, JR, 0) = 0 for all jL, JR ∈ {0, . . ., 2n} (no hatred if no guests) 5. Original: x(0, -1, -1, n), min hatred of adjacent guests by respectfully seating all guests 6. Time • # subproblems: though there are four parameters, there are only O(n³) subproblems for which either j₁ = i 1 or j = i -1 • Work per subproblem: O(1), so O(n³) time in total
//// ANSWER: 
To determine a respectful seating order that minimizes the sum of mutual hatred between adjacent guests using an O(n³)-time algorithm, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort Guests**: Arrange the guests in increasing order of their favor into an array \( F = (f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_{2n-1}) \). This ensures that guests with higher favor are considered first.

2. **Define Subproblems**: For each guest \( i \), and possible numbers of guests seated to the left (\( n_1 \)) and right (\( (n - i) - n_1 \)), determine the minimum total hatred when seating guest \( i \) either to the left or right of the Queen. The subproblem is defined as \( x(i, JL, JR, N_1) \), where:
   - \( i \) is the current guest being seated.
   - \( JL \) and \( JR \) indicate the previous guests seated next to the Queen on the left and right, respectively.
   - \( N_1 \) is the number of guests seated to the left.

3. **Recurrence Relation**: Decide whether to place guest \( i \) on the left or right based on which option gives lower hatred:
   - If placing guest \( i \) on the left costs hatred \( d(i, j_L) \), then \( x(i, JL, JR, N_1) = \min(d(i, j_L) + x(i+1, i, j_R, N_1-1)) \).
   - If placing guest \( i \) on the right costs hatred \( d(j_R, i) \), then \( x(i, JL, JR, N_1) = \min(d(j_R, i) + x(i+1, j_L, i, (N_1-1))) \).

4. **Topological Order**: Compute subproblems in order from smaller indices to larger ones, ensuring that each subproblem depends only on previously computed values.

5. **Base Case and Original Subproblem**:
   - Base case: When there are no guests left (\( i = 2n \)), the hatred is zero.
   - Original subproblem: Start with \( x(0, -1, -1, n) \), meaning all guests are to be seated with none on either side.

6. **Time Complexity**: Each of the \( O(n^3) \) subproblems is solved in constant time, leading to an overall \( O(n^3) \) algorithm.

By systematically exploring all possible seating arrangements through dynamic programming and considering each guest's placement relative to previous guests, we can find the optimal seating arrangement with minimal total hatred. This approach ensures that we efficiently minimize the sum of mutual hatred between adjacent guests while respecting the constraints of the problem.

QUESTION: Given an array A containing n distinct positive integers, describe an O(n²)-time algorithm to determine whether four integers from A form a Pythagorean Quad, where integers from A may appear more than once in the Quad. State whether your running time is worst-case, expected, and/or amortized. //// ANSWER: First, we observe that it suffices to find (a, b, c, d) such that a² + b² = d² – c². Let P be the set of n² ordered pairs of integers from A, where integers in A may be repeated in a pair. Construct an empty hash table H, and for each pair (a, b) ∈ P, compute and insert value a² + b² into H. Then for each pair (c, d) ∈ P, compute and lookup value d² – c² in H. If the value is in H, then some a² + b² equals some d² – c², so return that a Pythagorean Quad exists. Otherwise, if no d² - c² exists in H, then return that a Pythagorean Quad does not exist. Each a² + b² or d² – c² value takes constant time to compute, so computing them all takes worst-case O(n²) time, while inserting them into or looking them up in the hash table takes expected O(n²) time, so this algorithm runs expected in O(n²) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm described efficiently determines whether a Pythagorean Quad exists within an array of distinct positive integers. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Generate All Pairs**: For each element `a` and `b` in the array, compute the sum of their squares (`s = a² + b²`) and store these sums in a hash table.

2. **Check for Valid Quads**: For each pair `(c, d)`, compute the difference of their squares (`t = c² - d²`). Check if `t` exists in the hash table storing previous sums.

3. **Return Result**: If any valid sum and difference match are found, a Pythagorean Quad exists; otherwise, it does not.

**Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n²) time because it processes all possible ordered pairs twice (once for sums and once for differences), each operation being constant time on average due to hashing.

**Answer**: Yes, the algorithm correctly determines if a Pythagorean Quad exists with an expected running time of O(n²).

QUESTION: Describe a database to store animal sightings, supporting the following four operations, where n is the number of sightings stored in the database at the time of the operation. State whether your running times are worst-case, expected, and/or amortized. initialize() add_sighting(s, i) remove_oldest() is_common(s) //// ANSWER: To implement the database, maintain the following data structures: • A hash table H mapping each species s to a Set AVL tree T • Each Set AVL Tree T』 stores pairs (i, ci) of zone numbers i and the count ci representing the number of sightings of species s in zone i, keyed by zone number. • Augment each node x in each T, by the maximum number of sightings x.m of any zone in the subtree of x. x.m can be maintained in O(1) time from the augmentations of x's children, specifically x.m = max{x.left.m,x.key,x.right.m}. • A doubly-linked list L of all current sightings (s, i) in the order in which they were added to the database (oldest at the front). To implement initialize(), initialize an empty H and empty L in worst-case O(1) time. To implement add_sighting(s, i), lookup s in H to find T, in expected O(1) time (if s does not exist in H, insert s mapping to an empty T, in expected amortized O(1) time). Then find zone i in Ts. If zone i is not in Ts, insert (i, 1) into Ts. Otherwise, i is in Ts, so remove (i, ci) from Ts and reinsert (i, c₁ + 1). It takes worst-case O(log n) time to remove or insert items from T, while maintaining augmentations (since at most n sightings could exist for species s). Lastly, Insert (s, i) to the back of L in worst-case O(1) time. Thus this operation takes O(log n) expected amortized time, and maintains the invariants of the database directly. To implement remove_oldest (), remove the oldest pair (s, i) from the front of L in worst-case O(1) time. Lookup s in H to find T, in expected O(1) time; then lookup i in Ts and decrease Ci by one. If ci is decreased to zero, remove i from Ts. If Ts becomes empty, remove s from H in expected amortized O(1) time. This operation takes O(log n) expected amortized time, and maintains the invariants of the database directly. To implement is_common(s), simply lookup s in H and return whether s is in H and the stored max at the root of T is 100 or greater in expected O(1) time. This operation is correct based on the invariants of the data structure.
//// ANSWER: 
To design a database that efficiently manages animal sightings with the specified operations, we can use the following data structures and approach:

### Data Structures:
1. **Hash Table (H)**: This stores species `s` as keys, mapping to an AVL tree (`T_s`) that keeps track of counts per zone.
2. **AVL Tree (`T_s`)**: For each species `s`, this tree maintains pairs `(i, c_i)` where `i` is the zone and `c_i` is the count. Each node also tracks the maximum count in its subtree to support efficient queries.
3. **Doubly-Linked List (L)**: Maintains the order of sightings by oldest at the front.

### Operations:

1. **initialize()**:
   - Initializes an empty hash table `H` and an empty linked list `L`.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) (worst-case).

2. **add_sighting(s, i)**:
   - Lookup species `s` in `H`. If not present, create a new AVL tree with zone `i` set to 1.
   - Update the count for zone `i` in `T_s`, incrementing by 1 if already exists or adding it otherwise.
   - Append `(s, i)` to the end of `L`.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(log n) (AVL tree operations), where `n` is the number of sightings for species `s`.

3. **remove_oldest()**:
   - Remove the oldest sighting from the front of `L`.
   - Update counts in `H` and `T_s`. If a species' count drops to zero, remove it from both structures.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(log n) (AVL tree operations).

4. **is_common(s)**:
   - Check if species `s` exists in `H` and its maximum count in `T_s` is at least 100.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) due to direct hash table lookups.

### Summary:

- The hash table allows for O(1) average time complexity for add/remove operations, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
- AVL trees ensure that each insertion, deletion, and query operation runs in logarithmic time relative to the number of nodes, maintaining efficiency even as data grows.
- The linked list maintains the order of sightings efficiently, allowing quick access to the oldest entry.

This approach ensures that all operations are handled efficiently, supporting scalability and performance requirements for managing animal sightings.

QUESTION: Given a k-even-mixed array A containing n distinct integers for k = [n/lgn], describe an O(n)-time algorithm to sort A. //// ANSWER: Scan through A and put all even integers in order into an array AE and all odd integers in order into an array Ao (where |AE| = k and |Ao| = n k). Ao is sorted by definition, and we can sort AĘ in O(k logk) = O((n/lgn) log(n/lgn)) = O(n) time, e.g., via merge sort. Then we can merge sorted AE and Ao back into A in O(n) time using the merge step of merge sort, using O(n) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem efficiently, we can leverage a two-step process that separates and sorts the even and odd integers separately before merging them. This method ensures that each part is processed optimally, leading to an overall linear time complexity.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Separate Even and Odd Integers:**
   - Traverse through the array A once.
   - Place all even integers into a new array called `evenArray`.
   - Place all odd integers into another new array called `oddArray`.
   
2. **Sort the Even Array:**
   - Use an efficient sorting algorithm like Merge Sort on `evenArray`.
   - The time complexity for this step is O(k log k), where k is the number of even integers in A.
   - Since k ≈ n / log n, the complexity simplifies to O(n).

3. **Merge Sorted Arrays:**
   - Now, both `evenArray` and `oddArray` are sorted individually (or by definition if they were already ordered).
   - Use a simple two-pointer technique to merge these two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
   - The merging process runs in O(n) time as it involves iterating through each element exactly once.

**Efficiency:**
- **Sorting:** The sorting of the even integers takes O(k log k), which is approximately O(n).
- **Merging:** The merge operation is linear, taking O(n) time.
- **Total Complexity:** Combining both steps results in an overall time complexity of O(n).

This approach ensures that we efficiently sort large arrays by breaking down the problem into manageable parts and utilizing optimal sorting and merging techniques.

QUESTION: Let A be an array of n pairs of positive integers (xi, Yi) with Xi, Yi < n² for all i ∈ {0, . . ., n − 1}. The power of pair (x, y) is the integer x + nº. Describe an O(n)-time algorithm to sort the pairs in A increasing by power. //// ANSWER: First note that x < ny for any integer y > 1 and for any x ∈ {0, . . ., n²−1}. Scan through A and put all pairs having y = 1 into array A₁, and all other pairs into array A2. Sort A₁ directly by computing and comparing their respective powers x+n. Since these values are bounded above by O(n²), sort A₁ in O(n) time using Radix sort. To sort A2, use tuple sort, sorting first by x values and then by y values (since power is more sensitive to changes in y). Since the x and y values are both bounded above by O(n²), we can use Radix sort for tuple sort's stable sorting algorithm to sort A2 in O(n) time. Then merge A₁ and A2 back into A in O(n) time using the merge step of merge sort, using O(n) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
The sequence is ordered such that each pair (x, y) appears in increasing order of the value \( x + n^y \). This means that as you move through the list, the sum of x and \( n^y \) increases.

**Answer:**
The pairs are arranged in ascending order based on the sum \( x + n^y \), so each subsequent pair has a higher value of this expression.

QUESTION: Given an n × m array representing an image, describe an O(nm)-time algorithm to count the number of blobs in the image. //// ANSWER: Construct a graph G with a vertex per white pixel, with an undirected edge between two vertices if the pixels associated with them are both white and share an edge of the grid. This graph has size at most O(nm) vertices and at most O(nm) edges (as pixels share edges with at most four other pixels), so can be constructed in O(nm) time. Each connected component of this graph corresponds to a blob, so run Full-BFS or Full-DFS to count the number of connected components in G in O(nm) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To count the number of blobs in an n × m image array efficiently using an O(nm)-time algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through each pixel**: Traverse every pixel in the image grid from top-left to bottom-right.

2. **Identify unvisited white pixels**: For each pixel that is white and has not been visited yet:
   - Begin a BFS or DFS traversal.
   - Mark all connected white pixels (adjacent horizontally or vertically) as part of the same blob.

3. **Count connected components**: Each time you start a new BFS/DFS, increment the blob count by 1. This represents a new connected component in the image.

This method ensures that each pixel is processed exactly once, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(nm), which meets the requirement for efficiency.

QUESTION: Given a connected undirected graph G = (V, E) with strictly positive weights w : E → Z+ where |E| = |V|, describe an O(|V|)-time algorithm to determine a path from vertex s to vertex t of minimum weight. //// ANSWER: Given two vertices in a weighted tree containing only positive weight edges, there is a unique simple path between them which is also the minimum weight path. A depth-first search from any source vertex s in the tree results in a directed DFS tree in O(|V|) time (since |E| = |V| – 1). Then relaxing edges in topological sort order of the directed DFS tree computes minimum weight paths from s in O(|V|) time. Since G has one cycle, our strategy will be to break the cycle by removing an edge, and then compute the minimum weight path from s to t in the resultant tree. First, we find the vertex v closest to s on the cycle by running depth-first search from s in O(|V|) time (since |E| = |V|). One edge e₁ of the cycle will not be in the tree returned by DFS (a back edge to v), with the other edge of the cycle incident to v being a single outgoing DFS tree edge 62. If s is on the cycle, v = s; otherwise the unique path from s to v does not contain e1 or e2. A shortest path from s to t cannot traverse both edges e₁ and e2, or else the path would visit v at least twice, traversing a cycle of positive weight. Removing either e1 or e2 results in a tree, at least one of which contains the minimum weight path from s to t. Thus, find the minimum weight path from s to t in each tree using the algorithm described above, returning the minimum of the two in O(|V|) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the number of edges between leaf nodes in an undirected graph, we can follow these steps:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of nodes and their respective neighbors to construct the adjacency list representation of the graph.
2. **Identify Leaf Nodes**: Determine which nodes are leaves (nodes with exactly one neighbor).
3. **Check Edges Between Leaves**: For each leaf node, check its neighbors to see if any of them are also leaf nodes and count such edges.

Here is a Python implementation that efficiently solves this problem:

```python
n = int(input())
adj = {}
for _ in range(n):
    parts = input().split()
    u = int(parts[0])
    neighbors = set(map(int, parts[1:]))
    adj[u] = neighbors

leaves = {u for u in adj if len(adj[u]) == 1}

result_set = set()

for u in leaves:
    for v in adj[u]:
        if v > u and v in leaves:
            result_set.add((u, v))

print(len(result_set))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of nodes `n` and then constructs an adjacency list where each node points to a set of its neighbors.
- **Identifying Leaves**: Nodes with exactly one neighbor are identified as leaves using a set comprehension.
- **Checking Edges Between Leaves**: For each leaf node, we check each of its neighbors. If the neighbor is also a leaf (and greater than the current node to avoid duplicate checks), we add this edge to our result set. This ensures each edge between two leaves is counted exactly once.

This approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging sets for quick membership testing and ensuring each pair of nodes is only processed once, leading to an optimal solution.

QUESTION: Describe an O(nlog n)-time algorithm to find the shortest driving route from the power plant back home that avoids driving within driving distance k of a doughnut shop (or determine no such route exists). //// ANSWER: Construct a graph G with a vertex for each of the n city locations, and an undirected edge between two locations if there is a road connecting them, with each edge weighted by the positive length of its corresponding road. The degree of each vertex is bounded by a constant (i.e., 5), so the number of edges in G is O(n). First, we identify vertices that are within driving distance k of a doughnut shop location: create an auxiliary vertex x with a 0-weight outgoing edge from x to every doughnut shop location, and run Dijkstra from x. Remove every vertex from the graph whose shortest path from x is less than or equal to k, resulting in graph G' ⊂ G. If either p or h are not in G', then no route exists. Otherwise, run Dijkstra from p in G'. If no path exists to h, then no valid route exists. Otherwise, Dijkstra finds a shortest path from p to h, so return it (via parent pointers). This algorithm runs Dijkstra twice. Since the size of either graph is O(|V|), Dijkstra runs in O(|V| log |V|) = O(nlog n) time (e.g. using a binary heap to implement a priority queue).
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm involves constructing a graph where each city is a node, connected by roads as edges with weights corresponding to road lengths. An auxiliary node is added and connected to all doughnut shops with zero-weight edges. Dijkstra's algorithm is run from this auxiliary node to identify cities within k miles of any doughnut shop, which are then excluded from the graph. If the power plant or home is among these excluded cities, no valid route exists. Otherwise, Dijkstra's algorithm is run again on the filtered graph starting from the power plant to find the shortest path to home, ensuring it avoids doughnut shops within k miles.

**Answer:**

The described algorithm efficiently finds the shortest driving route avoiding doughnut shops by:

1. **Graph Construction:** Create a graph G with n vertices (city locations) and edges representing roads with weights as road lengths.
2. **Auxiliary Node Setup:** Introduce an auxiliary node x connected to each doughnut shop location via zero-weight edges, enabling identification of cities within k miles.
3. **Exclusion Process:** Run Dijkstra's algorithm from x to compute distances; any city reachable within k miles is excluded, forming a filtered graph G'.
4. **Connectivity Check:** Ensure both the power plant (p) and home (h) are present in G'; if not, no valid route exists.
5. **Path Finding:** Apply Dijkstra's algorithm on G' starting from p to determine reachability of h; return the shortest path if found.

This approach ensures an O(n log n)-time complexity due to two runs of Dijkstra's algorithm, each operating in O(n log n) time with a binary heap, making it efficient for large graphs.

QUESTION: Given directed graph G = (V, E) having arbitrary edge weights w : E → Z and two vertices s, t ∈ V, describe an O(|V|³)-time algorithm to find the minimum weight of any path from s to t containing at least |V| edges. //// ANSWER: Our strategy will compute intermediate values for each vertex v ∈ V: 1. the minimum weight w₁ (v) of any path from s to v using exactly |V| edges, and then 2. the minimum weight w₂(v) of any path from v to t using any number of edges. First, to compute (1), we make a duplicated graph similar to Bellman-Ford, but without edges corresponding to remaining at a vertex. Specifically, construct a graph G₁ with • |V| + 1 vertices for each vertex v ∈ V: vertex vk for k ∈ {0, . . ., |V|} representing reaching v from s along a path containing k edges; and • |V| edges for each edge (u, v) ∈ E: edge (uk−1, Uk) of the same weight for k ∈ {1, ...,|V|}. Now a path in G₁ from so to υν for any v ∈ V corresponds to a path from s to v in G through exactly |V| edges. So solve SSSPs in G₁ from so to compute the minimum weight of paths to each vertex traversing exactly |V| edges. This graph is acyclic, and has size O(|V|(|V| + |E|)) = O(|V|³), so we can solve SSSP on G₁ via DAG relaxation in O(|V|³) time. Second, to compute (2), we make a new graph G2 from G where every edge is reversed. Then every path to t in G corresponds to a path in G2 from t, so compute SSSPs from t in G2 to find the minimum weight of any path from v to t in G using any number of edges, which can be done in O(|V||E|) = O(|V|³) time using Bellman-Ford. Once computed, finding the minimum sum of w₁(v) + w₂(v) over all vertices v ∈ V will provide the minimum weight of any path from s to t containing at least |V| edges, since every such path can be decomposed into its first |V| edges and then the remainder. This loop takes O(|V|) time, so the algorithm runs in O(|V|³) time in total.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the minimum weight path from vertex \( s \) to vertex \( t \) in a directed graph \( G = (V, E) \) with arbitrary edge weights and ensuring the path contains at least \( |V| \) edges, we can follow these steps:

### Approach
1. **Construct an Intermediate Graph \( G_1 \):**
   - Create a layered graph where each vertex \( v \in V \) is represented by two states: \( v_k \) for reaching \( v \) in exactly \( k \) steps.
   - For each edge \( (u, v) \) with weight \( w \), add an edge from \( u_{k-1} \) to \( v_k \) in \( G_1 \).
   - Initialize distances such that the distance to \( s_0 \) is 0 and all other vertices are set to infinity.

2. **Compute Minimum Distances for Exactly \( |V| \) Steps:**
   - Process each layer from 0 to \( |V| \), updating the minimum distances using edges between consecutive layers.
   - This ensures that we compute the shortest path from \( s \) to every vertex in exactly \( |V| \) steps, giving us \( w_1(v) \) for all \( v \in V \).

3. **Reverse the Graph and Compute Shortest Paths:**
   - Reverse all edges of \( G \) to form a new graph \( G' \).
   - Run Bellman-Ford from \( t \) in \( G' \) to compute the shortest paths from each vertex \( v \in V \) to \( t \), giving us \( w_2(v) \).

4. **Combine Results to Find Minimum Path Weight:**
   - For each vertex \( v \) that is reachable in exactly \( |V| \) steps and can reach \( t \), compute the total weight as \( w_1(v) + w_2(v) \).
   - The minimum of these values is the desired result.

### Explanation
- **Graph Construction:** The graph \( G_1 \) is constructed to represent paths of exactly \( |V| \) steps, ensuring we can compute the shortest path for each vertex after exactly that number of steps.
- **Layered Processing:** By processing each layer step-by-step, we efficiently update distances without considering longer paths beyond \( |V| \).
- **Reversed Graph:** Reversing the graph allows us to find the shortest paths from any vertex to \( t \) using any number of edges, which is combined with the precomputed \( w_1(v) \) values.
- **Combining Results:** The final step combines the results from both steps to determine the minimum path weight that meets the problem's constraints.

QUESTION: Design a database to help Criminal Seafood maintain its wait list supporting the following operations, each in O(1) time. State whether each operation running time is worst-case, amortized, and/or expected. //// ANSWER: Maintain a doubly-linked list containing customers on the wait list in order, maintaining a pointer to the front of the linked list corresponding to the front of the wait list, and a pointer to the back of the linked list corresponding to the back of the wait list. Also maintain a hash table mapping each customer name to the linked list node containing that customer. To implement $add\_name(x)$, create a new linked list node containing name x and add it to the back of the linked list in worst-case O(1) time. Then add name x to the hash table pointing to the newly created node in amortized expected O(1) time. To implement $remove\_name (x)$, lookup name x in the hash table in and remove the mapped node from the linked list in expected O(1) time. Lastly, to implement $seat ()$, remove the node from the front of the linked list containing name x, remove name x from the hash table, and then return x, in amortized expected O(1) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To design an efficient database for Criminal Seafood's waitlist supporting add_name, remove_name, and seat() operations in O(1) time, the following approach is recommended:

### Data Structure Selection
- **Doubly-Linked List**: This structure allows constant-time insertion at both ends (front and back). Each node contains a customer's information.
- **Hash Table**: Maps each customer name to its corresponding linked list node for quick lookups.

### Operations Implementation

1. **add_name(x)**:
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a new node with the customer's details.
     2. Append this node to the end of the doubly-linked list.
     3. Insert the name into the hash table pointing to the new node.
   - **Time Complexity**: Worst-case O(1) for adding to the linked list and amortized expected O(1) for the hash table insertion.

2. **remove_name(x)**:
   - **Steps**:
     1. Lookup the customer's name in the hash table to find their node.
     2. Remove the node from the doubly-linked list (adjusting pointers if necessary).
     3. Delete the entry from the hash table.
   - **Time Complexity**: Amortized expected O(1) for both operations due to hashing efficiency.

3. **seat()**:
   - **Steps**:
     1. Retrieve the customer at the front of the linked list using its head pointer.
     2. Remove this node from both the linked list and the hash table.
     3. Return the customer's name.
   - **Time Complexity**: Amortized expected O(1) for accessing the head and removing from the hash table.

### Considerations
- Ensure handling of an empty waitlist to avoid errors in operations.
- Assume unique names to prevent conflicts in the hash table, or handle duplicates as needed.

This approach ensures that each operation is performed efficiently with minimal overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications.

QUESTION: Describe a database that can store Mether's sensor data and support the following operations, each in worst-case O(log n) time where n is the number of measurements in the database at the time of the operation. //// ANSWER: Maintain a Set AVL tree L storing distinct measurement latitudes, where each latitude l maps to a rainfall Set AVL tree R(l) containing all measurement triples with latitude l, keyed by time. We only store nodes associated with measurements, so the height of each Set AVL tree is bounded by O(log n). For each rainfall tree, augment each node p with the maximum rainfall p.m of any measurement within p's subtree. This augmentation can be maintained in constant time at a node p by taking the maximum of the rainfall at p and the augmented maximums of p's left and right children (if they exist); thus this augmentation can be maintained without effecting the asymptotic running time of standard AVL tree operations. To implement $record\_data (r, l, t)$, search L for latitude l in worst-case O(log n) time. If l does not exist in L, insert a new node corresponding to l mapping to a new empty rainfall Set AVL tree, also in O(log n) time. In either case, insert the measurement triple to R(l), for a total running time of worst-case O(log n). To implement $peak\_rainfall (l,t)$, search L for latitude l in worst-case O(logn) time. If l does not exist, return zero. Otherwise, perform a one-sided range query on R(l) to find the peak rainfall at latitude l since time t. Specifically, let $peak(v, t)$ be the maximum rainfall of any measurement in node v's subtree measured at time > t (or zero if v is not a node): $peak(v, t) = \begin{cases} max \{v.item.r, v.right.m, peak(v.left, t)\} & \text{if } v.t > t \\ peak(v.right, t) & \text{if } v.t < t \end{cases}$ Then peak rainfall is simply peak(v,t) with v being the root of the tree, which can be computed using at most O(log n) recursive calls. So this operation runs in worst-case O(log n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The database design involves two main structures: an AVL tree L storing distinct measurement latitudes and a collection of Set AVL trees R(l), one for each latitude l. Each R(l) contains all rainfall measurements at latitude l, indexed by time.

### Data Structure Design:

1. **Set L (Latitude Tree):**
   - An AVL tree where each node represents a unique latitude.
   - Operations: Insert, Delete, Search in O(log n) time.

2. **Rainfall Trees R(l) (Per Latitude Trees):**
   - For each latitude l, an AVL tree R(l) stores all measurements at l, indexed by time.
   - Each node in R(l) contains:
     - A measurement triple: (time, rainfall).
     - The maximum rainfall value in its subtree beyond a certain time.

### Operations:

1. **Recording Data (record_data(r, l, t)):**
   - Search for latitude l in L using O(log n) operations.
   - If l exists, insert the measurement into R(l). This involves updating each node's max value to include the new measurement and propagate this update up the tree.
   - If l does not exist, create a new entry in L and R(l), then insert the measurement. Both operations take O(log n) time.

2. **Peak Rainfall (peak_rainfall(l, t)):**
   - Search for latitude l in L using O(log n) operations.
   - If l does not exist, return 0.
   - Otherwise, query R(l) to find the maximum rainfall where the measurement time is greater than t. This involves traversing R(l)'s nodes and checking each node's max value based on its subtree times.

### Efficiency:

- Both insertion and peak rainfall queries are handled in O(log n) time due to the properties of AVL trees, ensuring efficient operations even as data grows.

This design ensures that both maintaining the set of latitudes and querying peak rainfall are performed efficiently with logarithmic time complexity.

QUESTION: Given T and P, describe an O(n + m)-time algorithm to return a gameplay of maximum total value. //// ANSWER: To solve this problem, it would be useful to be able to check whether a particular array of at most 10 positive integers is a playable word. Construct an empty hash table D and insert each $p_i$ for $i \in {0, . . ., m – 1}$ into D, mapping to its value $v(p_i)$. Each hash table insertion takes expected constant time (as each $p_i$ has constant size), so constructing D takes expected O(m) time. Now we solve the problem via dynamic programming. 1. Subproblems • x(i): the maximum total value of any gameplay on suffix T[i :] for $i \in {0, . . ., n}$ 2. Relate • Left-most playable word either starts with $t_i$ or it does not • If playable word starts with $t_i$, word may have any length in {1, . . ., 10} (Guess!) • $x(i) = max\{x(i+1)}\cup\{D[T[i : i + j]] + x(i + j)\ 3. Topo • x(i) only depends on subproblems with strictly larger i, so acyclic 4. Base • x(n) = 0 (empty gameplay admits no value) 5. Original • Solve subproblems via recursive top down or iterative bottom up • x(0) is the maximum value of any gameplay on T • Store parent pointers to reconstruct an optimal gameplay 6. Time • # subproblems: n + 1 = O(n) • Work per subproblem: expected O(1) • Together with hash table construction, yields expected O(n + m) time • (See scratch S2 for common mistakes)
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm to find a gameplay with maximum total value given T (the sequence of tokens) and P (the set of playable words with their scores) can be described as follows:

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Create a hash table \( D \) where each key is a playable word from \( P \), and the corresponding value is its score.
   - This preprocessing step takes \( O(m) \) time, where \( m \) is the number of playable words.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - Define an array \( x \) where \( x(i) \) represents the maximum total value of any gameplay starting from position \( i \) in \( T \).
   - The size of this array will be \( n + 1 \), where \( n \) is the length of \( T \).

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition:**
   - For each position \( i \) from \( n-1 \) down to \( 0 \):
     - Initialize \( x(i) \) as the value of \( x(i+1) \), which represents not starting a new playable word at \( i \).
     - Check all possible lengths \( j \) (from 1 to 10, since each playable word has constant size). For each length:
       - If the substring \( T[i:i+j] \) exists in \( D \):
         - Update \( x(i) \) as the maximum of its current value and \( D[T[i:i+j]] + x(i+j) \).
   - This step ensures that we consider all possible playable words starting at position \( i \).

4. **Base Case:**
   - Set \( x(n) = 0 \), representing an empty gameplay with no value.

5. **Reconstruction of Optimal Gameplay:**
   - Starting from \( x(0) \), backtrack through the array to determine which playable words were included in the optimal solution.
   - This involves checking, for each position \( i \), whether a playable word was chosen based on the maximum value found during the DP step.

### Time Complexity:
- **Preprocessing:** \( O(m) \)
- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The number of subproblems is \( n + 1 \).
  - Each subproblem involves checking up to 10 possible lengths (since each playable word has constant size), leading to an overall time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Thus, the total time complexity is \( O(n + m) \), as required.

### Final Answer:
The algorithm efficiently computes the maximum total value gameplay by leveraging dynamic programming and a hash table for quick lookups. It ensures that each subproblem is solved in constant time due to the limited number of possible playable word lengths (up to 10). The preprocessing step with the hash table further optimizes the solution, leading to an overall linear time complexity relative to the size of \( T \) and \( P \).

Answer: The algorithm runs in O(n + m) time by using dynamic programming to compute maximum values for each position in T, leveraging a hash table for efficient lookups.

QUESTION: Given a target sum m and two disjoint sets A and B, each containing exactly n distinct positive integers, describe an O(nm)-time algorithm to determine whether m is the sum of any limited-unlimited sequence S of A and B, i.e., $m = \sum_{s \in S} s$.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine if a target sum \( m \) can be achieved by selecting any number of distinct integers from sets \( A \) and \( B \), we can use a dynamic programming approach inspired by the 0-1 knapsack problem.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Combine Sets:** Merge \( A \) and \( B \) into a single set \( C = A \cup B \). Since both sets are disjoint, \( |C| = 2n \).

2. **Initialize DP Array:** Create a boolean array \( dp \) of size \( m+1 \), where \( dp[j] \) indicates whether sum \( j \) can be formed. Initialize \( dp[0] = true \) (sum zero is achievable with no elements) and the rest as false.

3. **Process Each Element:** For each integer \( c \) in set \( C \):
   - Iterate from \( m \) down to \( c \).
   - If \( dp[j - c] \) is true, set \( dp[j] = true \).

4. **Check Result:** After processing all elements, check if \( dp[m] \) is true. If yes, the sum \( m \) can be achieved; otherwise, it cannot.

**Time Complexity:**
- The algorithm processes each of the \( 2n \) elements in set \( C \).
- For each element, it performs \( O(m) \) operations.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(2nm) = O(nm) \), which meets the requirement.

This approach efficiently determines if the target sum can be formed using an \( O(nm) \)-time algorithm.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n³)-time algorithm to determine whether it is possible to assign the students equally to the three breakout rooms (i.e., n students to each room) while providing strictly positive help to every student, and if possible, return the maximum total benefit to students of any such assignment.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we can model it as a bipartite graph where students are connected to rooms based on their benefits. Each room must have exactly \( k = \frac{n}{3} \) students assigned to it. We aim to maximize the total benefit by finding an optimal assignment.

### Approach
1. **Check Divisibility**: Ensure that the number of students, \( n \), is divisible by 3. If not, output -1 as it's impossible to divide them into three equal groups.
2. **Model as Bipartite Graph**: Create a bipartite graph where each student can be connected to any room with an edge weight representing the benefit of assigning that student to the room.
3. **Hungarian Algorithm**: Use the Hungarian algorithm, which is efficient for solving assignment problems in polynomial time (O(n³)). This algorithm will find the optimal assignment maximizing the total benefit while ensuring each room has exactly \( k \) students.

### Explanation
The solution uses the Hungarian algorithm to solve the assignment problem efficiently. The key steps are:
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students and their respective benefits for each room.
2. **Divisibility Check**: Ensure \( n \) is divisible by 3; otherwise, output -1.
3. **Cost Matrix Construction**: Convert the benefit matrix into a cost matrix where higher values represent lower costs (since we are maximizing).
4. **Hungarian Algorithm Application**: The algorithm finds the optimal assignment minimizing the total cost, which translates to maximizing the original benefits.

This approach ensures that each room is assigned exactly \( k \) students while maximizing the total benefit.
