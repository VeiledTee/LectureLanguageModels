Q: Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows:  1 | 2 | 3 ----------  4 | 5 | ----------    |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables? 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables? 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables? 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored.  RB RBRB RBRBRBRB RBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB 5. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) in this same situation, give a list of all the assignments attempted, in sequence. Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None    | 1 = R   | 2= B   | 1= B    | 2= R   | 3= B   | 4= R   | 5= B   | |---------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R,B } |         |        |         |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R,B } | { B }   |        | { R }   |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R,B } | { R,B } | { R }  | { R,B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R,B } | { B }   | { B }  | { R }   | { R }  | { R }  |        |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }   | { B }   | {} â‡“   | { B }   | { B }  | { B }  | { B }  |        | 6. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) but with dynamic variable ordering, using the most-constrained-variable strategy, give a list of all the variable assignments attempted, in sequence. If there is a tie between variables, use the lowest-numbered one first. Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None     | 5 = B    | 2= R   | 1= B   | 3= B   | 4= R   | |---------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R, B } | { R }    |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  | { B }  |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R, B } | { R }    | { R }  | { R }  | { R }  |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }    |          |        |        |        |        | { }
A: Here is the Python code for the answer:

```python
def solve_sudoku(board):
    def is_valid(board, row, col, num):
        for x in range(9):
            if board == num or board == num:
                return False
        start_row = row - row % 3
        start_col = col - col % 3
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                if board == num:
                    return False
        return True

    def solve(board):
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                if board == 0:
                    for num in range(1, 10):
                        if is_valid(board, i, j, num):
                            board = num
                            if solve(board):
                                return True
                            board = 0
                    return False
        return True
    solve(board)
    return board
