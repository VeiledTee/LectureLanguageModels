Q: You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. 1. Domain: 2. Size of domain: 3. Satisfied constraints: 4. Binary constraints?: Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. 1. Domain: 2. Size of domain: 3. Satisfied constraints: 4. Binary constraints?: Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. 1. Domain: 2. Size of domain: 3. Satisfied constraints: 4. Binary constraints?:
A: To answer the question, let's consider the following formulation:

Formulation A:

Let $X$ be the set of 3k telescope observations, and let $X_i$ be the set of telescope observations of scientist $i$. Then, the variables are the 3k telescope observations.

Domain: $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$

Size of domain: $3k \in \mathbb{N}$

Satisfied constraints:

The constraints are satisfied because of the formulation, as each scientist has at most two observations that they can make.

Binary constraints: No binary constraints can be specified in this formulation.

Formulation B:

Let $X$ be the set of 3k telescope observations, and let $X_i$ be the set of telescope observations of scientist $i$. Then, the variables are the 3k telescope observations.

Domain: $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$

Size of domain: $3k \in \mathbb{N}$

Satisfied constraints:

The constraints are satisfied because of the formulation, as each scientist has at most two observations that they can make.

Binary constraints: No binary constraints can be specified in this formulation.

Formulation C:

Let $X$ be the set of 3k telescope observations, and let $X_i$ be the set of telescope observations of scientist $i$. Then, the variables are the 3k telescope observations.

Domain: $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$

Size of domain: $3k \in \mathbb{N}$

Satisfied constraints:

The constraints are satisfied because of the formulation, as each scientist has at most two observations that they can make.

Binary constraints: No binary constraints can be specified in this formulation.
