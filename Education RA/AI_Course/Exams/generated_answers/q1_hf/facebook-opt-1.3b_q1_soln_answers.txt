QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C .

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C .

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G1: A → B A → D B → C B → D B → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why
