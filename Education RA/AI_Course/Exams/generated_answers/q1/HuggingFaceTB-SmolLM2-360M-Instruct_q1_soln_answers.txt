QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot.

Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 .

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited.
