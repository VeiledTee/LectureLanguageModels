QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 .

The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 5. This can be treated as a path search problem. We would like to find a heuristic. Say whether each of these possible heuristics would be useful in finding the optimal path or, if not, what's wrong with them. Let l be the number of rocks already collected. H1 : The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H2 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H3 : The distance back to the lander
//// ANSWER: (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H4 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H5 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H6 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H7 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H8 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H9 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H10 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H11 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H12 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not.
