QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms > 1.1 Games > The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.:
//// ANSWER: The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration of the game tree, which means it explores the game tree by recursively exploring the possible moves and their outcomes, starting from the current game state. The algorithm maintains two values, alpha and beta, which represent the best possible score for the maximizing player (the player who wants to win) and the minimizing player (the player who wants to minimize the score), respectively. The algorithm then uses these values to determine the best move for the current player.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction > You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time.
The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints:
C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution).
C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.
Consider the following three formulations of the problem.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > 1. Use a set of the variables above to describe the rover's state. Do not include extraneous information.:
//// ANSWER: The rover's state is described by the following variables:

* `x`: the rover's position on the Martian surface
* `y`: the rover's velocity in the x-direction
* `z`: the rover's velocity in the y-direction
* `vx`: the rover's velocity in the x-direction
* `vy`: the rover's velocity in the y-direction
* `vz`: the rover's velocity in the z-direction

The rover's state is described by the following equations:

* `x = x0 + vx * t`
* `y = y0 + vy * t`
* `z = z0 + vz * t`
* `vx = vx0 + vx * t`
* `vy = vy0 + vy * t`
* `vz = vz0 + vz * t`

The rover's state is described by the following equations:

* `x = x0 + vx * t`
* `y = y0 + vy * t`
* `z = z0 + vz * t`
* `vx = v

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > 2. Specify the goal test.:
//// ANSWER: **2. Specify the goal test:**

The goal test is a way to specify the objective of a problem. It's a way to define what the problem is trying to achieve. In this case, the goal test is:

"The goal of this problem is to determine whether a given string of characters is a valid English word."

This means that the problem is trying to find a way to determine whether a given string of characters is a valid English word.

**3. Specify the problem formulation:**

The problem formulation is the way you describe the problem in a clear and concise manner. It should include the goal test, any constraints or assumptions, and any relevant information about the problem.

In this case, the problem formulation might look like this:

"Write a Python function that takes a string of characters as input and returns True if the string is a valid English word, and False otherwise. The function should satisfy the following constraints:

* The string must contain at least one letter.
* The string must contain at least one vowel (a, e, i, o, u).

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > 3. Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.:
//// ANSWER: The actions in this problem are:

* `add_to_inventory`: Adds an item to the inventory.
* `remove_from_inventory`: Removes an item from the inventory.
* `check_inventory`: Checks the inventory to see if an item is present.
* `display_inventory`: Displays the inventory.
* `add_to_cart`: Adds an item to the cart.
* `remove_from_cart`: Removes an item from the cart.
* `check_out`: Checks out from the store.
* `check_in`: Checks in to the store.

These actions modify the state by adding or removing items from the inventory, checking the inventory, displaying the inventory, adding or removing items from the cart, checking out, and checking in. They also have preconditions, such as checking if the inventory is empty before adding an item, or checking if the cart is empty before removing an item.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration.
· It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge.
· It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square.
· It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square.
The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander.
Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world:
· types of rocks already collected
· current rover location (square on map)
· current lander location (square on map)
· weight of rocks at current location (square on map)
· cost to traverse the current location (square on map)
· time since last charged
· time since departure from lander
· current day
· current battery charge level
· total battery capacity
· distance to lander
· total weight of currently collected rocks:
//// ANSWER: 10 units
· distance to current location: 10 units
· distance to current lander: 10 units
· distance to current day: 10 units
· distance to current battery charge level: 10 units
· distance to current battery capacity: 10 units

Write a Python function to calculate the optimal plan for the rover, given the above variables. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a plan for the rover's exploration. The first element of the tuple is the plan for the current day, and the second element is the plan for the current location. The plan for the current location should be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a plan for the rover's exploration of a square on the map. The first element of the tuple is the plan for the current location, and the second element is the plan for the current location's distance to the lander. The plan for the current location should be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a plan for the rover's exploration of a square on the map. The first element of the tuple is the plan for the current location, and the second element is the plan for the current location's distance to the lander.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces > Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes.
G:
A (1) → B
A (3) → D
A (2) → B
B (5) → C
B (6) → G
B (4) → D
D (1) → C
D (3) → G
C (1) → G
For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with
1. Depth first search
2. Breadth first search
3. Uniform cost search
4. A* search
5. Best-first (greedy) search
In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used
H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 }
H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 }
Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific.
