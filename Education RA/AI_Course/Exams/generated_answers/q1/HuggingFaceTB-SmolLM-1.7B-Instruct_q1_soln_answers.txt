QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms > 1.1 Games > The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.:
ANSWER: Answer concisely in English without code: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005  1 Search Algorithms  1.1 Games  The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.:

The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration of the game tree, which involves exploring the game tree from the root node to a pre-specified depth. This algorithm is commonly used in games like chess, tic-tac-toe, and other games where the game tree is large and complex.

The algorithm works by maintaining two values: the best move (alpha) and the best score (beta). The best move is the move that maximizes the score, while the best score is the score that minimizes the score. The algorithm explores the game tree by recursively exploring the possible moves and their outcomes, and updates the best move and best score accordingly.

The algorithm starts by initializing the best move and best score to the root node. It then explores the game tree by recursively exploring the possible moves and their outcomes. For each node, it evaluates the best move and best score using the alpha-beta algorithm. The algorithm then updates the best move and best score based on the evaluation.

The algorithm continues to explore the game tree until it reaches a pre-specified depth or a terminal state. At this point, the algorithm returns the best move and best score.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction > You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time.
The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints:
C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution).
C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.
Consider the following three formulations of the problem.
A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots.
B . The variables are the m scientists.
C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests.
For each formulation, specify

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > 3. Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.:
ANSWER: Answer concisely in English without code: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005  4 Search Problem formulation  3. Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.:

The actions in this problem are:

* `add_to_list`: Adds a new element to the list.
* `remove_from_list`: Removes an element from the list.
* `search`: Searches for an element in the list.

These actions modify the state by adding or removing elements from the list, and they also have preconditions for being used. For example, `add_to_list` only works if the list is not empty, and `remove_from_list` only works if the list is not empty.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration.
· It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge.
· It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square.
· It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square.
The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander.
Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world:
· types of rocks already collected
· current rover location (square on map)
· current lander location (square on map)
· weight of rocks at current location (square on map)
· cost to traverse the current location (square on map)
· time since last charged
· time since departure from lander
· current day
· current battery charge level
· total battery capacity
· distance to lander
· total weight of currently collected rocks:

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces > Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes.
G:
A (1) → B
A (3) → D
A (2) → B
B (5) → C
B (6) → G
B (4) → D
D (1) → C
D (3) → G
C (1) → G
For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with
1. Depth first search
2. Breadth first search
3. Uniform cost search
4. A* search
5. Best-first (greedy) search
In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used
H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 }
H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 }
Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific.
Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure).:
