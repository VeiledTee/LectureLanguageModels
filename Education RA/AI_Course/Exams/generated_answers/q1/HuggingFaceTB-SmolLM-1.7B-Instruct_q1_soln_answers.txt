QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms > 1.1 Games > The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.:
//// ANSWER: Answer concisely in English without code: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005  1 Search Algorithms  1.1 Games  The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.:

The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration of the game tree by recursively exploring the game tree from the root node to a pre-specified depth, and then backtracking to explore the remaining nodes. This algorithm is commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence to determine the best move for a player in a game.

**Question 2:**

Write a Python function `get_file_paths(root_dir, extension)` that takes two arguments: `root_dir` and `extension`. The function should return a list of file paths that match the given `extension` and are located in the `root_dir` directory. The function should use a recursive approach to traverse the directory tree and find files with the given extension.

Your code should pass the following test case:
```python
root_dir = '/path/to/root/directory'
extension = '.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction > You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time.
The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints:
C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution).
C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.
Consider the following three formulations of the problem.
A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots.
B . The variables are the m scientists.
C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests.
For each formulation, specify
1 . The value domain for the variables.
2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ).
3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > 2. Specify the goal test.:
//// ANSWER: Answer concisely in English without code: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005  4 Search Problem formulation  2. Specify the goal test.:

**2. Specify the goal test:**

The goal test is a way to specify the objective of a test. It's a way to define what the test is trying to achieve.

In this case, the goal test is:

"The goal of this test is to determine whether the test is passing or failing."

This means that the test is trying to determine whether the test is successful or unsuccessful.

**3. Specify the test:**

The test is a way to verify that the test is passing or failing. It's a way to check whether the test is working correctly.

In this case, the test is:

"The test is a way to verify that the test is passing or failing."

This means that the test is a way to check whether the test is successful or unsuccessful.

**4. Specify the test's behavior:**

The test's behavior is the way the test is expected to behave. It's the expected outcome of the test.

In this case, the test's behavior is:

"The test's behavior is to verify that the test is passing or failing.

* `checkout`: This action checks out the customer.

The preconditions for being used are:

* The customer has a valid order.
* The customer has a valid cart.

The actions modify the state by adding or removing items from the cart, checking out the customer, and updating the order status.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation > Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration.
· It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge.
· It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square.
· It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square.
The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander.
Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world:
· types of rocks already collected
· current rover location (square on map)
· current lander location (square on map)
· weight of rocks at current location (square on map)
· cost to traverse the current location (square on map)
· time since last charged
· time since departure from lander
· current day
· current battery charge level
· total battery capacity
· distance to lander
· total weight of currently collected rocks:

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces > Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes.
G:
A (1) → B
A (3) → D
A (2) → B
B (5) → C
B (6) → G
B (4) → D
D (1) → C
D (3) → G
C (1) → G
For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with
1. Depth first search
2. Breadth first search
3. Uniform cost search
4. A* search
5. Best-first (greedy) search
In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used
H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 }
H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 }
Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific.
Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure).:
