QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 1. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using breadth-first search in this application.
//// ANSWER: Alpha-beta pruning is specifically designed for depth-first search (DFS) to efficiently explore game trees by eliminating branches that cannot influence the final decision. Its primary advantage lies in its ability to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, making it much more efficient than a naive DFS or breadth-first search (BFS) when finding optimal moves.

To address whether alpha-beta pruning can be generalized for breadth-first exploration while still obtaining an optimal answer:

1. **Feasibility**: Alpha-beta pruning relies on maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of, respectively. These values are updated as nodes are explored in a DFS manner, allowing for effective pruning of branches.

   In BFS, all nodes at a given depth level are explored before moving to the next level. This fundamentally changes how alpha and beta values can be used because BFS does not naturally lend itself to the backtracking mechanism that allows alpha-beta pruning to work efficiently with DFS. Without this backtracking, it becomes challenging to maintain accurate alpha and beta bounds across different levels of the tree.

2. **Optimality**: While BFS explores all nodes at a given depth before moving deeper, it doesn't inherently support the pruning strategy needed for optimal decision-making in adversarial games like chess or checkers. Alpha-beta pruning's effectiveness is tied to its ability to cut off branches that cannot affect the final decision based on previously explored paths, which is more naturally aligned with DFS.

3. **Advantages and Disadvantages**:
   - **Advantages of BFS**: In some scenarios, BFS can be advantageous for finding the shortest path or exploring all possible states at a given depth before proceeding deeper. However, these advantages do not translate well to game tree exploration where optimal decision-making is required.
   
   - **Disadvantages in Game Trees**: Using BFS in game trees would require evaluating potentially exponential numbers of nodes without the ability to prune non-promising branches effectively. This makes it computationally expensive and impractical for large game trees, as it does not leverage the strategic insights that alpha-beta pruning provides.

In conclusion, while theoretically possible to adapt alpha-beta pruning to a BFS framework, doing so would negate its primary advantage: efficient pruning of irrelevant branches. Therefore, alpha-beta cannot be effectively generalized to perform breadth-first exploration while still guaranteeing an optimal answer in game tree scenarios. The depth-first nature of alpha-beta is crucial for its success in these applications.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 2. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application.
//// ANSWER: Yes, alpha-beta pruning can indeed be generalized to perform a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree while still obtaining the optimal answer.

### Explanation:

**Progressive Deepening:**
- Progressive deepening is a strategy where the search algorithm explores the game tree incrementally at increasing depths. It starts with a shallow depth and progressively increases it, repeating the search process until the desired maximum depth or time limit is reached.
  
**Alpha-Beta Pruning:**
- Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree by eliminating branches that cannot influence the final decision.

### Generalization to Progressive Deepening:

1. **Implementation:**
   - At each depth level, perform a standard alpha-beta search.
   - Use the results from shallower searches to inform and improve the efficiency of deeper searches (e.g., move ordering).
   - Continue this process until reaching the desired maximum depth or running out of time.

2. **Optimality:**
   - Progressive deepening ensures that the optimal move is found at each depth level, as alpha-beta pruning guarantees optimality within the explored portion of the tree.
   - By progressively increasing the search depth, it eventually explores the entire game tree up to the maximum specified depth, ensuring an optimal decision based on available information.

### Advantages:

1. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - Progressive deepening requires less memory than a full-depth search because only one level of the tree is stored in memory at any time.
   
2. **Move Ordering:**
   - Results from shallower searches can be used to improve move ordering for deeper searches, enhancing the effectiveness of alpha-beta pruning.

3. **Time Management:**
   - Allows for better management of computational resources by providing increasingly accurate results over time, which is useful in real-time decision-making scenarios (e.g., chess engines).

4. **Iterative Deepening:**
   - Provides a way to handle time constraints effectively, as it can return the best move found within any given time limit.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Redundant Work:**
   - Nodes are evaluated multiple times at different depths, which can lead to redundant computations.
   
2. **Overhead:**
   - The overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping searches at each depth level can be significant, especially if the tree is large.

In summary, progressive deepening with alpha-beta pruning is a powerful technique that maintains optimality while offering practical benefits in terms of memory usage and time management. Despite some computational redundancy, its advantages often outweigh these drawbacks in complex game scenarios.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: In the scenario described—a path search problem with a very large branching factor and solutions involving relatively short sequences of actions—the most suitable search algorithm to find the optimal answer is **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Here’s why BFS is appropriate:

1. **Optimality**: Breadth-First Search guarantees finding the shortest path in terms of the number of steps, which aligns with your requirement for a solution involving a short sequence of actions.

2. **Uniform Cost**: Since all actions have the same cost, BFS will naturally find the optimal solution by exploring all nodes at the present "depth" or level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

3. **Short Sequences**: Given that solutions involve relatively short sequences of actions, BFS is efficient because it explores shallow depths first and thus finds a solution quickly without needing to explore deeper levels unnecessarily.

### Conditions for Using Visited or Expanded Lists:

- **Visited List**: A visited list (or set) is crucial in any search algorithm to prevent revisiting the same state multiple times. This is especially important when dealing with large branching factors, as it helps avoid redundant work and reduces memory usage by not storing states that have already been processed.

- **Expanded List**: An expanded list keeps track of nodes that have been fully explored (i.e., all their successors have been generated). While BFS does not strictly require an expanded list to function correctly, maintaining such a list can be beneficial for efficiency. It helps in quickly checking whether a node has been fully processed, which is useful if you need to implement optimizations or modifications like iterative deepening.

### Summary:

- **Algorithm**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) because it guarantees finding the shortest path with uniform action costs.
- **Visited List**: Always use a visited list to avoid redundant processing and manage memory efficiently.
- **Expanded List**: Consider using an expanded list for efficiency, especially in complex implementations or when optimizing performance further.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively tackle the problem of finding optimal solutions in scenarios characterized by large branching factors and short solution paths.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: In a path search problem characterized by a very large branching factor and solutions that involve relatively short sequences of actions with widely varying costs, the A* (A-star) algorithm is typically the most suitable choice for finding an optimal solution. Here's why:

### Why Use A*?

1. **Optimality**: A* guarantees finding the least-cost path to a goal if it uses an admissible heuristic, which means the heuristic never overestimates the true cost from any node to the goal.

2. **Efficiency with Heuristics**: The algorithm combines both the actual cost to reach a node (known as `g(n)`) and an estimated cost from that node to the goal (`h(n)`), forming the evaluation function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`. This allows A* to prioritize paths that are more promising, potentially reducing the number of nodes explored.

3. **Handling Varying Costs**: Since A* considers both the path cost and heuristic estimates, it is well-suited for problems where action costs vary widely. The algorithm can effectively navigate these variations by adjusting its search focus based on accumulated costs (`g(n)`) and estimated remaining costs (`h(n)`).

### Conditions for Using a Visited or Expanded List

- **Visited List**: A visited list (or closed set) is crucial in preventing the algorithm from revisiting nodes that have already been processed. This can significantly enhance efficiency, especially in large search spaces with high branching factors, by avoiding redundant work.

  - **When to Use**: Always use a visited list when implementing A* to ensure each node is expanded only once unless there's a more promising path found later (which might be considered in some implementations).

- **Expanded List**: An expanded list (or open set) keeps track of nodes that have been discovered but not yet processed. This helps manage which nodes should be explored next based on their `f(n)` values.

  - **When to Use**: Always maintain an expanded list to efficiently select the next node with the lowest estimated total cost (`f(n)`) for expansion.

### Additional Considerations

- **Heuristic Choice**: The effectiveness of A* heavily depends on the quality of the heuristic. An admissible and consistent (or monotonic) heuristic will ensure optimality and efficiency.

- **Memory Constraints**: While A* is powerful, it can be memory-intensive due to storing all nodes in the expanded list. In cases where memory is a constraint, consider using iterative deepening A* (IDA*) or other memory-efficient variants like SMA* (Simplified Memory-bounded A*).

In summary, for a path search problem with a large branching factor and varying action costs, A* is an excellent choice due to its ability to efficiently find optimal paths by balancing actual costs and heuristic estimates. Using both visited and expanded lists is essential for managing the search process effectively.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: In this problem, you're dealing with a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where each square on a 3x3 board is a variable that can take one of two values: red (R) or black (B). The constraint is that no two adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) can have the same color.

Given this setup, let's analyze what happens when we apply full constraint propagation to the initial state. Initially, each square has the domain { R, B } because any square can potentially be either red or black.

### Constraint Propagation

Constraint propagation involves applying constraints to reduce the domains of variables. In this case, the constraint is that adjacent squares must have different colors. Let's apply this step-by-step:

1. **Initial Domains:**
   - All squares (1 through 5) start with the domain { R, B }.

2. **Applying Constraints:**
   - For each pair of adjacent squares, we enforce the constraint that they cannot be the same color.
   - Consider square 1:
     - It is adjacent to squares 2 and 4.
     - If square 1 is R, then square 2 must be B and square 4 must be B.
     - If square 1 is B, then square 2 must be R and square 4 must be R.

3. **Propagation:**
   - Let's start with square 5 (the center), which is adjacent to squares 2, 3, 4, and 6 (though we're only considering up to square 5 here).
   - If square 5 is R:
     - Square 2 must be B.
     - Square 3 must be B.
     - Square 4 must be B.
   - If square 5 is B:
     - Square 2 must be R.
     - Square 3 must be R.
     - Square 4 must be R.

4. **Further Propagation:**
   - Now consider the implications for squares 1 and 6 (though not part of our initial set, it helps visualize):
     - If square 5 is R:
       - Square 2 is B, so square 1 can be either R or B.
       - Square 4 is B, so square 1 can be either R or B.
     - If square 5 is B:
       - Square 2 is R, so square 1 can be either R or B.
       - Square 4 is R, so square 1 can be either R or B.

### Resulting Domains

After applying full constraint propagation:

- **Square 1:** { R, B }
- **Square 2:** { R, B } (but constrained by adjacent squares)
- **Square 3:** { R, B } (constrained by square 5)
- **Square 4:** { R, B } (constrained by square 5)
- **Square 5:** { R, B }

However, due to the constraints from adjacent squares, the actual choices for each square are limited based on its neighbors. For example:

- If square 5 is R, then squares 2, 3, and 4 must be B.
- If square 5 is B, then squares 2, 3, and 4 must be R.

Thus, while the domains remain { R, B } for each variable initially, the constraints effectively reduce the feasible combinations of colors across the board. The propagation doesn't eliminate any values from individual domains but restricts the overall solution space by enforcing that adjacent squares have different colors.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem, we need to understand how constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) work and apply constraint propagation techniques like arc consistency.

### Problem Setup

We have a 3x3 checkerboard with five squares numbered as follows:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

However, we are only considering the first five squares: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The constraints are that adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) cannot have the same color.

### Initial Domains

Initially, each variable (square) has a domain of {R, B}. However, we restrict the domain of square 5 to {B}.

### Constraints

- Square 1 is adjacent to squares 2 and 4.
- Square 2 is adjacent to squares 1, 3, and 5.
- Square 3 is adjacent to squares 2 and 5.
- Square 4 is adjacent to squares 1 and 5.
- Square 5 is adjacent to squares 2, 3, and 4.

### Constraint Propagation

We will apply arc consistency using the AC-3 algorithm:

1. **Arc (5, 2):**  
   - Since square 5 is restricted to {B}, square 2 cannot be B.
   - Domain of 2 becomes {R}.

2. **Arc (5, 3):**  
   - Square 5 is B, so square 3 cannot be B.
   - Domain of 3 becomes {R}.

3. **Arc (5, 4):**  
   - Square 5 is B, so square 4 cannot be B.
   - Domain of 4 becomes {R}.

Now, we check the remaining arcs:

4. **Arc (2, 1):**  
   - Square 2 is R, so square 1 cannot be R.
   - Domain of 1 becomes {B}.

5. **Arc (3, 2):**  
   - Square 3 is R and square 2 is R, which is consistent since they are not the same color.

6. **Arc (4, 1):**  
   - Square 4 is R and square 1 is B, which is consistent.

After applying constraint propagation, the resulting domains for each variable are:

- Domain of 1: {B}
- Domain of 2: {R}
- Domain of 3: {R}
- Domain of 4: {R}
- Domain of 5: {B}

These domains satisfy all adjacency constraints on the board.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables?
//// ANSWER: In a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) like this one, where you're assigning colors to squares on a checkerboard such that adjacent squares don't share the same color, forward checking is used to reduce the domain of possible values for each variable after an assignment. Here's how it works in your scenario:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Variables: Squares 1 through 5.
   - Domains: {R, B} for all variables initially.

2. **Assignment and Forward Checking:**
   - Assign square 1 the color R (Red).
   - Now apply forward checking to update the domains of adjacent squares based on this assignment.

3. **Effect on Adjacent Squares:**
   - Square 1 is adjacent to squares 2 and 4.
   - Since square 1 is assigned R, squares 2 and 4 cannot be R (to satisfy the constraint that adjacent squares must have different colors).

4. **Resulting Domains After Forward Checking:**
   - **Square 2:** Initially {R, B}. After forward checking with square 1 = R, domain becomes {B}.
   - **Square 3:** Not directly affected by square 1's assignment (no direct adjacency), so its domain remains {R, B}.
   - **Square 4:** Initially {R, B}. After forward checking with square 1 = R, domain becomes {B}.
   - **Square 5:** Adjacent to squares 2 and 3. At this point, since no assignment has been made yet for these squares, its domain remains {R, B}.

In summary, after assigning square 1 the color R and applying forward checking:
- Domain of Square 2: {B}
- Domain of Square 3: {R, B}
- Domain of Square 4: {B}
- Domain of Square 5: {R, B}

This process helps in reducing the search space by eliminating values that would lead to a constraint violation as soon as they become impossible.

We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored. RB RBRB RBRBRBRB RBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and how pure backtracking (BT) proceeds in a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). The goal is to color a 3x3 checkerboard such that adjacent squares do not share the same color. We focus on five specific squares: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, with the constraint that square 5 must be colored black (B).

### Problem Setup:
- **Variables**: Squares 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Domains**:
  - Square 1: {R, B}
  - Square 2: {R, B}
  - Square 3: {R, B}
  - Square 4: {R, B}
  - Square 5: {B} (fixed)

### Constraints:
- Adjacent squares cannot have the same color.
- Specifically, for our variables:
  - 1 and 2 are adjacent.
  - 2 and 3 are adjacent.
  - 1 and 4 are adjacent.
  - 4 and 5 are adjacent.

### Backtracking Procedure:
We will attempt to assign colors starting with square 1 and proceed in numerical order. We prioritize assigning R first, then B if R fails due to constraints.

#### Step-by-Step Exploration:

1. **Assign Square 1:**
   - Try R for Square 1.
     - Current assignment: 1 = R

2. **Assign Square 2:**
   - Try R for Square 2 (adjacent to 1).
     - Constraint fails because 1 = R and 2 cannot be R.
   - Try B for Square 2.
     - Current assignment: 1 = R, 2 = B

3. **Assign Square 3:**
   - Try R for Square 3 (adjacent to 2).
     - Current assignment: 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R

4. **Assign Square 4:**
   - Try R for Square 4 (adjacent to 1).
     - Constraint fails because 1 = R and 4 cannot be R.
   - Try B for Square 4.
     - Current assignment: 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R, 4 = B

5. **Assign Square 5:**
   - Must be B (fixed).
   - Check constraint with Square 4:
     - Constraint passes because 4 = B and 5 = B are adjacent.
   - Current assignment: 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R, 4 = B, 5 = B

This path is valid. Now, backtrack to explore other possibilities:

6. **Backtrack from Square 3:**
   - Try B for Square 3 (adjacent to 2).
     - Current assignment: 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = B
   - Assign Square 4:
     - Try R for Square 4 (adjacent to 1).
       - Constraint passes because 1 = R and 4 = R are not adjacent.
       - Current assignment: 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = B, 4 = R
     - Assign Square 5:
       - Must be B (fixed).
       - Check constraint with Square 4:
         - Constraint fails because 4 = R and 5 = B are adjacent.
   - Try B for Square 4 (adjacent to 1).
     - Constraint fails because 1 = R and 4 cannot be B.

7. **Backtrack from Square 2:**
   - Try R for Square 2 (adjacent to 1).
     - Constraint fails because 1 = R and 2 cannot be R.
   - Backtrack from Square 1:
     - Try B for Square 1.
       - Current assignment: 1 = B

8. **Assign Square 2:**
   - Try R for Square 2 (adjacent to 1).
     - Current assignment: 1 = B, 2 = R

9. **Assign Square 3:**
   - Try B for Square 3 (adjacent to 2).
     - Current assignment: 1 = B, 2 = R, 3 = B

10. **Assign Square 4:**
    - Try R for Square 4 (adjacent to 1).
      - Constraint passes because 1 = B and 4 = R are not adjacent.
      - Current assignment: 1 = B, 2 = R, 3 = B, 4 = R

11. **Assign Square 5:**
    - Must be B (fixed).
    - Check constraint with Square 4:
      - Constraint passes because 4 = R and 5 = B are adjacent.
    - Current assignment: 1 = B, 2 = R, 3 = B, 4 = R, 5 = B

This path is also valid.

### Summary of Valid Assignments:
- **Valid Assignment 1**: 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R, 4 = B, 5 = B
- **Valid Assignment 2**: 1 = B, 2 = R, 3 = B, 4 = R, 5 = B

These are the only valid assignments explored by pure backtracking given the constraints and domain restrictions.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 5.

//// ANSWER: To solve the problem using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) on a 3x3 checkerboard, we need to assign colors to five specific squares such that no two adjacent squares have the same color. The squares are numbered as follows:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 |
```

We will use two colors: Red (R) and Black (B). Each square is a variable with an initial domain of {R, B}. We'll attempt to assign colors using BT-FC, which involves choosing a value for a variable and then reducing the domains of its neighbors based on this assignment.

### Step-by-step Assignments:

1. **Assignment: 1 = R**
   - Domain of 2 becomes {B} (since it cannot be R).
   - Domain of 4 becomes {B} (since it cannot be R).

2. **Assignment: 2 = B**
   - Domain of 3 becomes {R} (since it cannot be B).
   - No change to domain of 1 or 5.

3. **Assignment: 3 = B**  
   This assignment is invalid because the domain of 3 only allows R after assigning 2 = B. We backtrack from here.

4. **Backtrack and try: 2 = R**
   - Domain of 1 becomes {B} (since it cannot be R).
   - Domain of 3 becomes {B} (since it cannot be R).
   - Domain of 5 becomes {B} (since it cannot be R).

5. **Assignment: 3 = B**
   - No change to domain of 2.
   - Domain of 1 remains {B}.
   - Domain of 5 remains {B}.

6. **Assignment: 4 = R**
   - Domain of 1 becomes {} (since it cannot be R and was already reduced to {B}).
   - Domain of 5 becomes {B} (since it cannot be R).

7. **Assignment: 5 = B**
   - No change to domain of 2, 3, or 4.

At this point, all variables have been assigned valid colors without any conflicts:

- 1 = B
- 2 = R
- 3 = B
- 4 = R
- 5 = B

### Sequence of Assignments Attempted:

1. 1 = R
2. 2 = B
3. 3 = B (invalid, backtrack)
4. 2 = R
5. 3 = B
6. 4 = R
7. 5 = B

This sequence reflects the assignments attempted in order using BT-FC on this specific subset of a checkerboard problem.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 6. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) but with dynamic variable ordering, using the most-constrained-variable strategy, give a list of all the variable assignments attempted, in sequence. If there is a tie between variables, use the lowest-numbered one first. Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None     | 5 = B    | 2= R   | 1= B   | 3= B   | 4= R   | |---------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R, B } | { R }    |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  | { B }  |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R, B } | { R }    | { R }  | { R }  | { R }  |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }    |          |        |        |        |        | { }
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) and dynamic variable ordering based on the most-constrained-variable strategy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Domains for all variables initially: {R, B}.
   - Constraints: Adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) must have different colors.

2. **Variable Ordering**:
   - At each step, choose the variable with the smallest domain (most constrained). If there's a tie, choose the lowest-numbered variable.

3. **Backtracking and Forward Checking Process**:

   - **Step 1**: 
     - All variables are equally constrained initially.
     - Choose variable 5 (lowest number among tied most-constrained variables).
     - Assign 5 = B.
     - Update domains:
       - Domain of 4: {R} (since 4 is adjacent to 5)
       - Domain of 2: {R, B}
       - Domain of 1: {R, B}

   - **Step 2**:
     - Most constrained variable now is 4 with domain {R}.
     - Assign 4 = R.
     - Update domains:
       - Domain of 5: {B} (already assigned)
       - Domain of 3: {B} (since 3 is adjacent to 4)
       - Domain of 2: {R}

   - **Step 3**:
     - Most constrained variable now is 2 with domain {R}.
     - Assign 2 = R.
     - Update domains:
       - Domain of 1: {B} (since 1 is adjacent to 2)
       - Domain of 5: {B} (already assigned)

   - **Step 4**:
     - Most constrained variable now is 1 with domain {B}.
     - Assign 1 = B.
     - Update domains:
       - Domain of 3: {B} (already constrained to B)
       - Domain of 2: {R} (already assigned)

   - **Step 5**:
     - Most constrained variable now is 3 with domain {B}.
     - Assign 3 = B.
     - Update domains:
       - All variables are assigned.

4. **Sequence of Variable Assignments**:

   - 5 = B
   - 4 = R
   - 2 = R
   - 1 = B
   - 3 = B

This sequence respects the constraints and uses forward checking to reduce domains dynamically, ensuring that no two adjacent squares have the same color.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: To address the question regarding **Formulation A**, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots, let's break down each part of the problem:

### 1. Value Domain for the Variables

In Formulation A, each variable represents a specific combination of an instrument and a time slot. The value domain for these variables is determined by whether or not an observation is scheduled in that particular instrument/time slot.

- **Domain:** Each variable can take on one of two values:
  - \(0\): No observation is scheduled in this instrument/time slot.
  - \(1\): An observation is scheduled in this instrument/time slot.

### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables

The size of the domain refers to the number of possible values each variable can take. Since each variable (instrument/time slot) can either be occupied by an observation or not, the size of the domain is:

- **Size:** \(2\) (since there are two possibilities: 0 or 1).

### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied

In this formulation, some constraints are inherently satisfied due to the nature of how variables and domains are defined:

- **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):** This constraint is naturally enforced because each variable corresponds to a unique instrument/time slot combination. Since each variable can only take on values 0 or 1, at most one observation can be scheduled for any given instrument in any given time slot.

### 4. Binary Constraints Specification

Binary constraints involve relationships between pairs of variables. Let's evaluate whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints:

- **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made):** This constraint involves ensuring that exactly two observations are selected for each scientist, which requires considering all \(n\) requests per scientist simultaneously. It cannot be directly expressed as a binary constraint because it involves more than two variables at once.

  - **Counterexample:** Consider a scientist with three requests: \(R_1\), \(R_2\), and \(R_3\). To satisfy C1, exactly two of these must be scheduled. This requires a ternary relationship among the variables representing these requests, not just pairwise relationships.

- **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** This constraint involves ensuring that if any observation is scheduled in a given time slot, all observations in that slot must share the same target. This also cannot be expressed as binary constraints because it requires considering all instruments within a single time slot simultaneously.

  - **Counterexample:** Consider a time slot with three instruments: \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\). If an observation is scheduled in \(I_1\) and another in \(I_2\), both must have the same target. This requires a relationship among all three variables, not just pairwise.

In summary, while some constraints are naturally satisfied by the formulation, others cannot be expressed as binary constraints due to their requirement for relationships involving more than two variables at once.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: To address the problem of scheduling observations on a space telescope with the given constraints and using Formulation A, let's break down each part of the question:

### Formulation A: The variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots.

1. **Value Domain for the Variables:**
   - Each variable represents an observation that can occur in one of the \(3k\) possible instrument/time slot combinations.
   - The value domain consists of all possible observations requested by scientists, or it could be a binary choice indicating whether a particular observation is scheduled (1) or not (0).

2. **Size of Domain for the Variables:**
   - There are \(3k\) variables since there are 3 instruments and \(k\) time slots.
   - Each variable can potentially represent any one of the \(mn\) observations requested by all scientists, assuming each observation is distinct across different combinations of target, instrument, and time slot.
   - Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable is \(mn + 1\), where \(+1\) accounts for the possibility that no observation is scheduled in a particular instrument/time slot.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied by the Formulation:**
   - **C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is satisfied because each variable corresponds to a specific instrument/time slot combination.
   - **C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target is inherently managed since each time slot can only be associated with one set of variables (one for each instrument), ensuring all selected observations in that slot share the same target.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification:**
   - **C1** (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) cannot be directly specified as binary constraints because it involves a global condition across multiple scientists' requests, not just pairwise interactions between variables.
   - **C2** can be expressed using binary constraints. For any two variables \(X_{i,j}\) and \(X_{i',j'}\) (representing different instrument/time slots), the constraint is:
     \[
     X_{i,j} + X_{i',j'} \leq 1
     \]
     if they share either the same time slot or the same instrument.
   - **C3** can also be expressed using binary constraints. For any two variables \(X_{i,t}\) and \(X_{i',t}\) (representing different instruments but the same time slot), the constraint is:
     \[
     X_{i,t} = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad X_{i',t} = 0
     \]
     unless they are targeting the same object. This ensures that if one observation is scheduled, any other must target the same object.

In summary, Formulation A effectively captures constraints C2 and C3 using binary constraints due to its structure of variables representing specific instrument/time slots. However, constraint C1 requires a more global approach beyond pairwise interactions and thus cannot be directly expressed as binary constraints in this formulation.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 3. Satisfied constraints:
//// ANSWER: To address the problem of scheduling observations on a space telescope with specific constraints, let's analyze Formulation A where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots.

### Formulation A: Variables are the \(3k\) Instrument/Time Slots

#### 1. Value Domain for the Variables
Each variable represents an instrument/time slot combination. The value domain consists of:
- No observation scheduled.
- An observation from a specific scientist's list, identified by the target and the instrument.

#### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables
For each instrument/time slot, there are \(m\) possible observations (one per scientist) or no observation at all. Therefore, the domain size is \(m + 1\).

#### 3. Satisfied Constraints
- **C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
  - This constraint is inherently satisfied because each variable corresponds to a unique instrument/time slot combination.

#### 4. Binary Constraints Specification

- **Constraint C1**: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
  - This cannot be directly expressed as binary constraints in this formulation. The reason is that C1 involves ensuring exactly two selections across all \(3k\) variables for each scientist, which requires counting and comparing across multiple variables.

- **Constraint C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
  - Already satisfied by the formulation itself, as explained above.

- **Constraint C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
  - This can be expressed using binary constraints. For any two variables representing different instruments in the same time slot, they must either both be empty or refer to the same target. If \(x_{i,t}\) and \(x_{j,t}\) are variables for instruments \(i\) and \(j\) at time slot \(t\), then:
    - If one is assigned a target, the other must be assigned the same target or remain unassigned.

### Summary
- **Value Domain**: \(\{ \text{no observation} \} \cup \{\text{observation by scientist } s \mid 1 \leq s \leq m\}\)
- **Domain Size**: \(m + 1\)
- **Inherently Satisfied Constraints**: C2
- **Binary Constraint Feasibility**:
  - C1 cannot be expressed as binary constraints.
  - C3 can be expressed using binary constraints.

This formulation effectively handles the scheduling problem by focusing on instrument/time slots, ensuring that certain constraints are inherently satisfied while others require additional mechanisms to enforce.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: Let's analyze the given problem and address each part of the question for **Formulation A**, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots.

### 1. Value Domain for the Variables

In Formulation A, each variable represents an instrument/time slot combination. The value domain for these variables is determined by which scientist's observation (if any) will be scheduled in that particular instrument/time slot. Since there are \(m\) scientists and each has a list of \(n\) observations, the possible values for each variable include:

- A specific observation from one of the \(mn\) total requests.
- An indication that no observation is scheduled in this slot (often represented as "null" or "empty").

Thus, the value domain consists of \(mn + 1\) possibilities: \(mn\) specific observations plus one option for no observation.

### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables

The size of the domain for each variable is \(mn + 1\), where:
- \(m\) is the number of scientists.
- \(n\) is the number of observations per scientist.
- The "+1" accounts for the possibility of not scheduling any observation in that slot.

### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied by the Formulation

In this formulation, certain constraints are inherently satisfied:

- **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):** This is naturally enforced because each variable corresponds to a unique instrument/time slot combination.
  
- **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** Since all variables for a given time slot correspond to different instruments but share the same time, ensuring that only one observation per time slot is chosen inherently satisfies this constraint.

### 4. Binary Constraints

Binary constraints involve relationships between pairs of variables. Let's evaluate whether the constraints can be expressed as binary constraints in this formulation:

- **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made):** This constraint cannot be directly expressed as a binary constraint because it involves ensuring that exactly two out of \(n\) possible observations for each scientist are selected. Binary constraints would require pairwise relationships, but C1 is inherently a global constraint on the set of variables associated with each scientist.

- **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):** This can be expressed as binary constraints. For any two variables corresponding to different instruments in the same time slot, we impose a constraint that they cannot both be assigned non-null values simultaneously.

- **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** This can also be expressed using binary constraints. For any pair of variables within the same time slot but corresponding to different instruments, we enforce that if one is non-null, the other must either be null or refer to an observation with the same target.

In summary, while C1 cannot be directly represented as a binary constraint in this formulation, C2 and C3 can be expressed using pairwise (binary) constraints.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot.

Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation B where the variables are the \(m\) scientists, we need to determine several aspects of this formulation:

### 1. Domain

The domain for each scientist variable is a subset of their list of requested observations. Since exactly two observations from each scientist's list must be scheduled (Constraint C1), the domain consists of all possible pairs of observations that can be chosen from each scientist's list.

### 2. Size of the Domain

Each scientist has \(n\) observations on their list, and we need to choose 2 out of these \(n\). The number of ways to choose 2 observations from \(n\) is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

Thus, the size of the domain for each scientist variable is \(\binom{n}{2}\).

### 3. Necessarily Satisfied Constraints

In this formulation, Constraint C1 is necessarily satisfied because the domain for each scientist variable is defined as pairs of observations from their list.

Constraints C2 and C3 are not inherently satisfied by this formulation. They need to be explicitly enforced through additional constraints between the variables representing different scientists.

### 4. Binary Constraints Specification

Constraints C2 and C3 cannot be fully specified as binary constraints in this formulation because they involve interactions among multiple scientists' choices:

- **Constraint C2** (At most one observation per instrument per time slot) involves ensuring that no two scientists choose observations that use the same instrument at the same time. This requires checking combinations of choices across different scientists, which cannot be reduced to binary constraints between pairs of scientist variables.

- **Constraint C3** (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) also involves multiple scientists' choices. It requires ensuring that if any two scientists choose observations in the same time slot, those observations must have the same target. Again, this cannot be reduced to binary constraints between pairs of scientist variables.

#### Counterexample

Consider three scientists \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) with overlapping time slots:

- \(S_1\) chooses observations \((T_1, I_1, t)\) and \((T_2, I_2, t')\).
- \(S_2\) chooses observations \((T_1, I_2, t)\) and \((T_3, I_3, t'')\).
- \(S_3\) chooses observations \((T_2, I_1, t')\) and \((T_3, I_2, t'')\).

To satisfy C2 and C3, we need to ensure that:

- No two scientists choose the same instrument at time \(t\).
- Observations at time \(t\) have the same target.

These constraints involve more than just pairs of scientists (e.g., checking all three scientists for conflicts at time \(t\)), demonstrating that binary constraints are insufficient.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation B, where the variables are the \(m\) scientists, we need to determine several aspects related to this formulation:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables**:
   - Each variable represents a scientist and needs to select exactly two observations from their list of \(n\) requested observations.
   - The value domain for each scientist is all possible pairs of observations they can choose from their list.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables**:
   - For each scientist, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 2 observations out of \(n\). This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{2}\).
   - Therefore, the size of the domain for each scientist is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied**:
   - Constraint C1 (exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) is inherently satisfied because each variable (scientist) selects exactly two observations.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification**:
   - Constraint C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot) and Constraint C3 (the observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) are not naturally binary constraints in this formulation.
   - In Formulation B, each variable is independent of others in terms of direct interaction; they only indirectly affect each other through shared resources (time slots and instruments).
   - To express these constraints as binary, we would need to introduce additional variables or mechanisms that directly relate pairs of scientists. For example:
     - **C2**: We could introduce auxiliary variables representing whether a specific instrument is used in a particular time slot by any scientist's chosen observation. This would require checking combinations of observations from different scientists.
     - **C3**: Similarly, we might need to track which target is associated with each pair of observations selected by different scientists for the same time slot.

   - A counterexample illustrating why these constraints cannot be directly expressed as binary in this formulation:
     - Suppose Scientist 1 selects Observations \(O_{11}\) and \(O_{12}\), and Scientist 2 selects \(O_{21}\) and \(O_{22}\). Without additional structure, there's no direct way to enforce that both observations from different scientists do not use the same instrument in the same time slot (C2) or have the same target (C3).

In summary, while Formulation B naturally satisfies Constraint C1, Constraints C2 and C3 require more complex interactions between variables than can be directly expressed as binary constraints without additional constructs.

//// ANSWER: In Formulation B, where the variables are the \(m\) scientists, we need to determine how this formulation handles the constraints and what its characteristics are.

### 1. Value Domain for the Variables

Since each scientist must have exactly two observations scheduled from their list of \(n\) requests, the value domain for each scientist is a set of pairs of observations chosen from their list. Each observation is specified by a target, an instrument, and a time slot.

### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables

For each scientist, we need to choose 2 observations out of \(n\). The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which represents the size of the domain for each scientist's variable. Therefore, the total size of the domain across all scientists is:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{m} \binom{n}{2}
\]

### 3. Satisfied Constraints

In this formulation, Constraint C1 is inherently satisfied because the value domain for each scientist's variable is defined as pairs of observations from their list.

Constraints C2 and C3 are not necessarily satisfied by default in this formulation. They need to be explicitly enforced through additional constraints on how these pairs interact with each other across different scientists.

### 4. Binary Constraints

The constraints can be specified as binary constraints, but it requires careful construction:

- **Constraint C1**: This is inherently satisfied by the choice of domain for each scientist's variable (pairs of observations).

- **Constraint C2**: To enforce that at most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled, we need to ensure that if two scientists have chosen observations involving the same instrument and time slot, those observations must be different. This can be expressed as a binary constraint between any pair of scientists \(i\) and \(j\):

  \[
  \text{If } (o_{i1}, o_{i2}) \text{ is chosen for scientist } i \text{ and } (o_{j1}, o_{j2}) \text{ is chosen for scientist } j, \\
  \text{then } o_{ik} \neq o_{jl} \text{ if they involve the same instrument and time slot.}
  \]

- **Constraint C3**: To ensure that all observations scheduled in a single time slot have the same target, we need to enforce that if two scientists have chosen observations for the same time slot, those observations must have the same target. This can also be expressed as a binary constraint between any pair of scientists \(i\) and \(j\):

  \[
  \text{If } (o_{i1}, o_{i2}) \text{ is chosen for scientist } i \text{ and } (o_{j1}, o_{j2}) \text{ is chosen for scientist } j, \\
  \text{then if they share a time slot, they must have the same target.}
  \]

In summary, while Formulation B inherently satisfies Constraint C1, Constraints C2 and C3 require explicit binary constraints between pairs of scientists to ensure that no two observations conflict in terms of instrument/time slot usage or target consistency within a time slot.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation B, where the variables are the \(m\) scientists, we need to address several aspects of this formulation:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables**:
   - Each scientist can be associated with a subset of their requested observations that will be scheduled. Since each scientist has submitted \(n\) observations and exactly two must be chosen (as per constraint C1), the value domain for each scientist is the set of all possible pairs of observations from their list.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables**:
   - For each scientist, there are \(\binom{n}{2}\) ways to choose 2 observations out of \(n\). Therefore, the size of the domain for each scientist's variable is \(\binom{n}{2}\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied by the Formulation**:
   - Constraint C1 (exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) is inherently satisfied because the value domain for each scientist is defined as pairs of observations.

4. **Binary Constraints?**:
   - The constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation, but with some considerations:

     - **Constraint C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot)**: This constraint involves ensuring that no two scientists' chosen observations overlap on the same instrument and time slot. For any pair of scientists \(i\) and \(j\), if they both choose an observation involving the same instrument at the same time slot, this would violate C2. Thus, for each pair of scientists, we can define a binary constraint that checks their selected pairs of observations to ensure no overlap on instruments and time slots.

     - **Constraint C3 (observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target)**: This constraint requires that if two or more scientists choose observations in the same time slot, those observations must all be aimed at the same target. For any pair of scientists \(i\) and \(j\), if they both select an observation in the same time slot, their chosen observations must share the same target. Therefore, a binary constraint can be defined for each pair of scientists to ensure that if they have overlapping time slots, the targets are identical.

In summary, while constraints C2 and C3 involve interactions between multiple scientists' choices, they can still be expressed as binary constraints by considering pairs of scientists at a time. Each pair must satisfy the conditions imposed by these constraints, ensuring no instrument-time slot conflicts (C2) and consistent target assignments for overlapping time slots (C3).

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.

The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation C, where the variables represent each of the \(mn\) individual observations requested by the scientists, we can analyze the problem as follows:

### 1. Domain

The domain for each variable (each observation request) is binary: \(\{0, 1\}\). Here, a value of 1 indicates that the specific observation request is scheduled, and a value of 0 means it is not.

### 2. Size of the Domain

Since each variable can be either 0 or 1, the size of the domain for each individual variable is 2. There are \(mn\) such variables (one for each scientist's request), but this does not affect the size of the domain for any single variable; it remains 2.

### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied

In this formulation, none of the constraints (C1, C2, or C3) are inherently satisfied by default due to the choice of variables alone. However, we can express these constraints using additional mechanisms:

- **Constraint C1**: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
  - This constraint requires that for each scientist \(i\), exactly two of their \(n\) requests (variables) must sum to 2.

- **Constraint C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
  - For any given time slot and instrument, the sum of all variables corresponding to observations using that instrument in that time slot should be at most 1.

- **Constraint C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
  - This requires that if one observation with a particular target is scheduled in a time slot, then any other observation scheduled in the same time slot must also have that target. If different targets are used, their corresponding variables should all be zero.

### 4. Binary Constraints

The constraints can indeed be specified as binary constraints in this formulation:

- **Constraint C1**: This constraint is not naturally binary because it involves ensuring exactly two observations per scientist. However, it can be expressed using a combination of unary and higher-order constraints (e.g., sum constraints).

- **Constraint C2**: This can be expressed as binary constraints by considering pairs of variables that correspond to the same instrument and time slot. For any pair of such variables \(x_i\) and \(x_j\), we have:
  \[
  x_i + x_j \leq 1
  \]
  This ensures at most one observation per instrument per time slot.

- **Constraint C3**: This constraint involves ensuring that all scheduled observations in a given time slot share the same target. For any two variables \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) corresponding to different targets but the same time slot, we can express:
  \[
  x_i + x_j \leq 1
  \]
  If both are scheduled (\(x_i = 1\) and \(x_j = 1\)), it violates this constraint.

In summary, while some constraints require more complex expressions than simple binary ones (like C1), others can be directly expressed as binary constraints. The formulation allows for the specification of these constraints using logical conditions on pairs or groups of variables.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time.

The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation C, where the variables represent each scientist's individual observation requests (totaling \(mn\) requests), we need to specify several aspects:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables:**
   - Each variable corresponds to a specific request from a scientist. The value domain for these variables is binary: either 0 or 1.
     - 0 indicates that the particular observation request is not scheduled.
     - 1 indicates that the particular observation request is scheduled.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\)):**
   - The size of the domain for each variable is 2, as each request can either be included in the schedule or not.
   - There are a total of \(mn\) variables since there are \(m\) scientists each with \(n\) requests.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied by the Formulation:**
   - **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made):** This constraint is naturally satisfied in this formulation because we can enforce that exactly two out of the \(n\) variables corresponding to a single scientist must be set to 1.
   - **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** This constraint can also be enforced by ensuring that if any request is selected (set to 1) for a particular time slot, all other requests in that time slot must either not conflict with this target or also be set to 0.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification:**
   - The constraints can indeed be specified as binary constraints in this formulation:
     - **C1:** For each scientist \(i\), we need exactly two of their \(n\) requests to be scheduled. This can be expressed using a constraint that sums the variables corresponding to scientist \(i\)'s requests and requires the sum to equal 2.
       \[
       \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} = 2 \quad \text{for each } i
       \]
     - **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):** For any given time slot \(t\) and instrument \(p\), we need to ensure that at most one request using that instrument in that time slot is selected. This can be expressed by ensuring the sum of variables for requests using instrument \(p\) in time slot \(t\) does not exceed 1.
       \[
       \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} \cdot \text{Instrument}(r_{ij}, p) \cdot \text{TimeSlot}(r_{ij}, t) \leq 1
       \]
     - **C3 (Same target for observations in a single time slot):** For any given time slot \(t\), if one request is selected, all other requests in that time slot must have the same target. This can be enforced by ensuring that if one variable corresponding to a request with target \(T\) is set to 1, then all others for that time slot must either also have target \(T\) or be set to 0.
       \[
       x_{ij} + x_{i'j'} \leq 1 + \text{Target}(r_{ij}, r_{i'j'}) \quad \forall t, \forall i, j, i', j'
       \]
       where \(\text{Target}(r_{ij}, r_{i'j'})\) is 1 if both requests have the same target and 0 otherwise.

In summary, Formulation C allows for a straightforward representation of constraints as binary constraints due to its direct mapping of variables to individual observation requests.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.

Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 3. Satisfied constraints:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation C, where the variables represent each of the \(mn\) scientists' requests for telescope observations, we can analyze how this formulation handles the problem's constraints:

### 1. Value Domain for the Variables

Each variable corresponds to a specific request from a scientist. The value domain for these variables is binary: either an observation is scheduled (value = 1) or it is not scheduled (value = 0).

### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables

Since each variable can take on one of two values (scheduled or not scheduled), the size of the domain for each individual variable is 2.

### 3. Satisfied Constraints

In this formulation, certain constraints are inherently satisfied due to how variables and their domains are defined:

- **C1: Exactly Two Observations per Scientist**  
  This constraint can be naturally enforced by ensuring that exactly two variables corresponding to a single scientist's requests take the value 1 (scheduled). This is not automatically satisfied by the formulation itself but must be explicitly imposed as part of the solution constraints.

### 4. Binary Constraints Specification

The constraints in this formulation can indeed be specified as binary constraints:

- **C2: At Most One Observation per Instrument per Time Slot**  
  For any two requests \(R_i\) and \(R_j\) that involve the same instrument at the same time slot, we impose a binary constraint:
  \[
  R_i + R_j \leq 1
  \]
  This ensures that both cannot be scheduled simultaneously.

- **C3: Observations in a Single Time Slot Must Have the Same Target**  
  For any two requests \(R_i\) and \(R_j\) that are scheduled at the same time slot but have different targets, we impose:
  \[
  R_i + R_j \leq 1
  \]
  This ensures that if one is scheduled, the other cannot be.

- **C1: Exactly Two Observations per Scientist**  
  For each scientist \(s\), with requests \(R_{s1}, R_{s2}, \ldots, R_{sn}\), we impose:
  \[
  R_{s1} + R_{s2} + \cdots + R_{sn} = 2
  \]
  This ensures exactly two observations are scheduled for each scientist.

### Conclusion

In Formulation C, constraints can be expressed as binary constraints. The formulation allows us to directly map the problem's requirements into a constraint satisfaction framework where each request is treated as an individual variable with a binary domain. Constraints are then applied between pairs of these variables or within groups corresponding to a single scientist's requests.

Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C, where the variables represent each of the \( mn \) individual observations requested by the scientists:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables**: 
   - Each variable can take one of two values: either "scheduled" (the observation is included in the final schedule) or "not scheduled."

2. **Size of the Domain**:
   - Since each variable has 2 possible states ("scheduled" or "not scheduled"), the size of the domain for each variable is 2.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied by Formulation**:
   - Constraint C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) can be naturally enforced in this formulation because you directly control which observations are selected.
   - Constraint C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is not inherently satisfied by this formulation. It requires additional constraints to ensure that if any observation for a particular instrument and time slot is scheduled, all others for that slot must be of the same target.

4. **Binary Constraints**:
   - The constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation with some considerations:

     - **Constraint C1**: For each scientist \( i \), you need to ensure exactly two observations are selected. This involves creating a constraint between every pair of variables (observations) for that scientist, ensuring that the sum of their values equals 2. If there are \( n \) observations per scientist, this results in \(\binom{n}{2}\) binary constraints per scientist.

     - **Constraint C2**: For each instrument and time slot combination, ensure at most one observation is scheduled. This involves creating a constraint between every pair of variables (observations) that could potentially be scheduled for the same instrument and time slot. If there are \( m \times n \) observations in total, but only those targeting the same time slot and using the same instrument need to be considered, this results in constraints between pairs of such observations.

     - **Constraint C3**: For each time slot and target combination, ensure that if one observation is scheduled, all others for that time slot must have the same target. This involves creating a constraint between every pair of variables (observations) within the same time slot but different targets. If there are \( m \times n \) observations in total, this results in constraints between pairs of such observations.

In summary, while the formulation allows for binary constraints to be specified, it requires careful construction of these constraints to ensure all conditions are met. The complexity arises from ensuring that the constraints correctly enforce the scheduling rules across potentially large numbers of observation requests.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 1. Use a set of the variables above to describe the rover's state. Do not include extraneous information.
//// ANSWER: To formulate the search problem for the Mars rover, we need to define its state using relevant variables that capture all necessary aspects of its environment and objectives. The state should allow us to track progress towards collecting rocks, managing resources like battery charge, and planning movements efficiently.

### State Representation

The rover's state can be described by a set of variables as follows:

1. **Current Rover Location (Square on Map)**: This variable indicates the current position of the rover on the map. It is essential for navigation and determining proximity to rocks or the lander.

2. **Types of Rocks Already Collected**: A list or set that keeps track of which types of rocks have been collected so far. This helps in ensuring that all 10 required types are gathered.

3. **Current Battery Charge Level**: The current amount of charge left in the rover's batteries, measured in units. This is crucial for planning movements and charging activities.

4. **Total Weight of Currently Collected Rocks**: This variable tracks the cumulative weight of rocks collected by the rover. It is important for evaluating the objective function that combines weight and distance.

5. **Current Day**: The current day since departure from the lander, which helps in ensuring the mission completes within three days.

6. **Distance to Lander**: The distance (in terms of map squares) from the current location to the lander. This is important for planning the return trip.

### Additional Considerations

- **Time Since Last Charged** and **Time Since Departure from Lander**: While these could be useful, they are not strictly necessary if we track the battery charge level directly and manage time through the day variable.
  
- **Weight of Rocks at Current Location (Square on Map)**: This can be accessed as needed when considering moving to a new location but does not need to be part of the state unless it simplifies decision-making.

- **Cost to Traverse the Current Location (Square on Map)**: Similar to rock weight, this information is used for planning movements and can be retrieved from the map as required.

### Objective

The objective is to collect one of each type of 10 rocks within three days while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. The tradeoff parameter \( \alpha \) converts units of weight to units of distance, allowing us to balance these two aspects in the cost function.

By using this state representation, we can effectively plan the rover's actions, manage its resources, and ensure it meets its objectives within the given constraints.

Specify the goal test.
//// ANSWER: To specify the goal test for this Mars rover exploration problem, we need to define a set of conditions that must be satisfied for the rover's mission to be considered complete successfully. The objective is for the rover to collect one of each of 10 types of rocks within three days while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled.

Here are the components needed for the goal test:

1. **Rock Collection Completion**: 
   - The rover must have collected at least one sample of each of the 10 different rock types specified in its mission objectives.
   - This can be checked using a list or set of `types of rocks already collected` and comparing it to the required set of all 10 types.

2. **Time Constraint**:
   - The rover must complete its task within three days.
   - This involves tracking the `current day` variable, ensuring that the mission is completed by the end of day 3.

3. **Return to Lander**:
   - After collecting all required rock samples, the rover must return to the lander's location.
   - The goal test should verify that the `current rover location` matches the `current lander location`.

4. **Battery Charge**:
   - While not explicitly part of the primary objective, ensuring that the rover has enough battery charge to return to the lander is crucial for mission success.
   - This involves checking that the `current battery charge level` is sufficient to cover the distance back to the lander.

5. **Minimization Objective (Optional)**:
   - Although not directly part of the goal test, ensuring that the rover has minimized a combination of total weight and distance traveled can be evaluated after the mission.
   - This involves calculating the `total weight of currently collected rocks` and the `distance to lander` at each step, using the tradeoff parameter α to balance these factors.

In summary, the goal test for this problem is satisfied when:
- All 10 types of rocks have been collected.
- The mission is completed within three days.
- The rover has returned to the lander's location.
- The rover has sufficient battery charge to ensure it can return safely.

These conditions collectively ensure that the rover completes its exploration task successfully according to the specified objectives.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 3. Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.
//// ANSWER: To formulate a search problem for the Mars rover's exploration task, we need to specify the actions it can take, how these actions modify its state, and any preconditions required for each action. Here are the key actions:

1. **Drive to a New Location:**
   - **Description:** The rover moves from its current location to an adjacent square on the map.
   - **State Modifications:**
     - Updates the current rover location to the new square.
     - Decreases the battery charge level by the units required for that move (as indicated by the map).
     - Increases the time since last charged and the time since departure from lander.
     - Updates the distance traveled.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The battery must have enough charge to complete the move.
     - The rover must be within three days of its departure time.

2. **Collect a Rock Sample:**
   - **Description:** The rover picks up a rock sample from its current location.
   - **State Modifications:**
     - Adds the type and weight of the collected rock to the list of types already collected.
     - Increases the total weight of currently collected rocks by the weight of the new rock.
     - Decreases the battery charge level by one unit.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must be at a location with an uncollected type of rock.
     - The battery must have at least one unit of charge.

3. **Charge Batteries:**
   - **Description:** The rover stops to unfurl its solar collectors and recharge its batteries.
   - **State Modifications:**
     - Increases the battery charge level by one unit (up to a maximum of 10 units).
     - Resets the time since last charged to zero.
     - Increases the time since departure from lander.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must not be at full battery capacity.

4. **Return to Lander:**
   - **Description:** The rover navigates back to its starting location, the lander.
   - **State Modifications:**
     - Updates the current rover location to the lander's location.
     - Decreases the battery charge level by the units required for the return path (as indicated by the map).
     - Increases the time since last charged and the time since departure from lander.
     - Updates the distance traveled.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must have enough battery charge to reach the lander.

5. **Wait:**
   - **Description:** The rover remains stationary for one hour, allowing its solar collectors to recharge if unfurled.
   - **State Modifications:**
     - Increases the time since last charged by one hour.
     - If solar collectors are unfurled, increases the battery charge level by one unit (up to a maximum of 10 units).
     - Increases the time since departure from lander.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must not be at full battery capacity if it intends to recharge.

These actions collectively allow the rover to explore, collect samples, manage its energy resources, and ensure it returns to the lander within the constraints of the mission.

Specify a function that determines the cost of each action. charge : move : pick-up-rock :
//// ANSWER: To construct an effective plan for the Mars rover's exploration, we need to define a cost function for each possible action: charging, moving, and picking up rocks. The goal is to optimize the collection of rock samples while minimizing both the total weight of collected rocks and the distance traveled, considering the constraints provided.

### Cost Function Components

1. **Distance Traveled**: This is a direct measure of how far the rover moves. It's important because we want to minimize this as part of our objective.
2. **Weight of Rocks Collected**: The total weight of rocks collected should be minimized. We use the tradeoff parameter \(\alpha\) to convert units of weight into equivalent units of distance for comparison purposes.
3. **Battery Usage**: Each action consumes battery charge, and managing battery levels is crucial since the rover must return to the lander with enough power.

### Cost Function Definitions

1. **Charge Action**:
   - **Cost**: 0 (since charging does not consume battery or move the rover)
   - **Effect**: Increases battery level by 1 unit per hour of charging, up to a maximum of 10 units.
   - **Constraints**: Can only be performed if the rover is stationary and has less than full charge.

2. **Move Action**:
   - **Cost**: 
     \[
     \text{Cost}_{\text{move}} = d + \alpha \times w
     \]
     where \(d\) is the distance to the target square (in units of map resolution), and \(w\) is the weight of rocks at the destination.
   - **Effect**: Decreases battery level by the cost associated with moving to that location. Updates the rover's current location.
   - **Constraints**: Can only be performed if there is sufficient battery charge to cover the move cost.

3. **Pick-up-Rock Action**:
   - **Cost**: 
     \[
     \text{Cost}_{\text{pick-up}} = 1 + \alpha \times w
     \]
     where \(w\) is the weight of the rock at the current location.
   - **Effect**: Decreases battery level by 1 unit (for picking up) and adds the rock to the collection if it's a new type. Updates the total weight of collected rocks.
   - **Constraints**: Can only be performed if there is sufficient battery charge and the rock type has not been collected yet.

### Objective Function

The overall objective function combines these costs, aiming to minimize:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \sum (\text{Cost}_{\text{move}} + \text{Cost}_{\text{pick-up}})
\]
subject to the constraints of battery capacity, time (three days), and returning to the lander.

### Additional Considerations

- **Time Management**: The rover must manage its time efficiently, as it has only three days. This includes accounting for time spent moving, collecting rocks, and charging.
- **Return Path**: Ensure that there is enough battery to return to the lander after collecting all required rock types.
- **Exploration Strategy**: Prioritize squares with uncollected rock types and consider proximity to the lander when planning the return trip.

By defining these cost functions and constraints, we can use search algorithms (like A* or Dijkstra's) to find an optimal path that satisfies the mission objectives while adhering to the rover's operational limits.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander.

This can be treated as a path search problem. We would like to find a heuristic. Say whether each of these possible heuristics would be useful in finding the optimal path or, if not, what's wrong with them. Let l be the number of rocks already collected. H1 : The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H2 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H3 : The distance back to the lander
//// ANSWER: To determine whether each heuristic is useful in finding an optimal path for the Mars rover problem, we need to evaluate them based on their ability to estimate the cost from any given state to a goal state. A good heuristic should be admissible (never overestimate the true cost) and consistent (satisfy the triangle inequality).

### Heuristic H1: 
**Description:** The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the \(10 - l\) closest locations for the missing types of rocks.

- **Evaluation:** This heuristic estimates the minimum distance required to reach each of the remaining rock types. However, it does not account for the need to return to the lander or consider battery constraints and time limits.
- **Conclusion:** H1 is not admissible because it underestimates the true cost by ignoring the return trip to the lander and other operational constraints like battery usage and time. It only considers distances without accounting for the full path required.

### Heuristic H2:
**Description:** The length of the shortest tour through the \(10 - l\) closest locations for the missing types of rocks.

- **Evaluation:** This heuristic attempts to estimate the cost by considering a tour that visits all remaining rock types. However, it still does not account for the need to return to the lander or battery constraints.
- **Conclusion:** H2 is closer to being useful than H1 because it considers visiting all necessary locations. However, it remains inadmissible as it ignores the requirement to return to the lander and other operational constraints like battery usage and time limits.

### Heuristic H3:
**Description:** The distance back to the lander.

- **Evaluation:** This heuristic only considers the cost of returning to the lander from the current location. It does not account for collecting any remaining rocks or managing battery levels.
- **Conclusion:** H3 is not useful as a standalone heuristic because it ignores the need to collect all rock types and manage resources like battery charge and time.

### Recommendations:
To construct a more effective heuristic, consider combining elements of these heuristics while incorporating additional factors such as:

1. **Return Path:** Include the distance from each potential collection point back to the lander.
2. **Battery Management:** Estimate energy costs for traveling and collecting rocks, ensuring the rover can return with sufficient charge.
3. **Time Constraints:** Ensure that the path respects the three-day limit.
4. **Weight Consideration:** Incorporate the tradeoff parameter \(\alpha\) to balance weight and distance.

A potential heuristic could be a weighted sum of:
- The shortest tour through remaining rock types (including return to lander).
- Battery usage estimates for each segment of the journey.
- Time required for travel, collection, and charging.

This combined approach would provide a more comprehensive estimate of the true cost from any state to the goal, making it both admissible and useful for guiding the search.

We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm.

Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes.

Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G1: A → B A → D B → C B → D B → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why
//// ANSWER: To analyze the search tree labeled G1 and determine which algorithm generated it, let's break down the process:

### Graph Analysis:
- **Nodes and Costs:**
  - A (start node)
    - To B with cost 3
    - To D with cost 2
  - B
    - To C with cost 5
    - To G with cost 6
    - To D with cost 4
  - D
    - To C with cost 1
    - To G with cost 3

### Search Tree G1:
- **Path:** A → B, A → D, B → C, B → D, B → G

### Analysis of G1:

1. **Algorithm:**
   - The tree shows that after expanding node A, it immediately explores both children B and D.
   - After exploring B, it continues to explore all its children (C, D, G) before backtracking.
   - This behavior is characteristic of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, which explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

2. **Heuristic (if any):**
   - BFS does not use a heuristic function as it simply expands nodes level by level.
   - Therefore, no heuristic is applicable here.

3. **Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why:**
   - BFS finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges but not necessarily the least-cost path when edge costs are considered.
   - In this graph, the least-cost path from A to G is A → D → G with a total cost of 2 + 3 = 5.
   - The path found by BFS in G1 includes A → B → G with a cost of 3 + 6 = 9, which is not optimal.
   - Therefore, BFS did not find the least-cost path because it does not consider edge costs, only the number of edges.

### Conclusion for G1:
- **Algorithm:** Breadth First Search (BFS)
- **Heuristic (if any):** None
- **Did it find least-cost path?** No, because BFS does not account for edge costs and finds paths based on the shortest number of edges rather than total cost.

Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G2: A (6) → B A (3) → D D (4) → C D → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why
//// ANSWER: To analyze the search tree labeled G2 and determine which algorithm generated it, we need to consider the characteristics of each algorithm and how they apply to the given scores and structure.

### 1. Algorithm:

The tree G2 is structured as follows:
- Start at A with a score of 6.
- Expand to B (score 3) and D (score 4).
- From D, expand to C (no score shown for C in this path) and then to G.

**Analysis:**
- **Depth First Search (DFS):** DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It does not consider scores or costs.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS):** BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It also does not use scores for decision-making.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** UCS expands the node with the lowest cumulative path cost from the start node. The scores in G2 do not reflect cumulative costs, so this is unlikely.
- **A* Search:** A* uses both the actual cost to reach a node and a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal. It requires specific heuristics to determine which nodes to expand next.
- **Best-first (Greedy) Search:** This search expands the node with the lowest estimated cost to the goal, using only the heuristic function.

Given that G2 uses scores at each step and selects D over B after A, it suggests a decision based on some scoring mechanism rather than just depth or breadth. The score of 4 for D is lower than the score of 3 for B, indicating a preference for nodes with lower scores.

This behavior aligns with **Best-first (Greedy) Search**, which selects nodes based solely on the heuristic value without considering the path cost from the start node.

### 2. Heuristic (if any):

Since G2 is identified as Best-first (Greedy) Search, it uses a heuristic function to determine the order of expansion. We need to identify which heuristic matches the scores used:

- **Heuristic H1:** { h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3 }
  - From A: B has a higher score (6) than D (3), matching the choice in G2.
  
- **Heuristic H2:** { h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2 }
  - From A: D would have a lower score (2) than B (3), which also matches the choice in G2.

Both heuristics could potentially explain the choice of expanding D over B from A. However, since the scores are explicitly given as part of the problem statement and match H1 directly for node B, we will assume **Heuristic H1** is used.

### 3. Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why?

To determine if G2 found the least-cost path, we need to calculate the actual costs:

- Path A → D → C → G:
  - Cost from A to D = 3
  - Cost from D to C = 1
  - Total cost = 3 + 1 = 4

- Path A → B → C → G (alternative path):
  - Cost from A to B = 2
  - Cost from B to C = 5
  - Total cost = 2 + 5 = 7

The path found by G2, A → D → C → G, has a total cost of 4, which is indeed the least-cost path.

**Conclusion:**
1. **Algorithm:** Best-first (Greedy) Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** H1
3. **Did it find the least-cost path?** Yes, it did find the least-cost path because the total cost of 4 is the minimum possible for reaching G from A.

This analysis shows that while G2 used a heuristic-based approach, it coincidentally found the optimal path due to the specific structure and costs in this graph.

We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm.

G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3.

If not, why
//// ANSWER: To analyze the search tree G3 and determine which algorithm generated it, we need to consider the characteristics of each type of search algorithm mentioned:

1. **Depth First Search (DFS):** This algorithm explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It does not necessarily visit nodes in order of their scores or costs.

2. **Breadth First Search (BFS):** This algorithm visits all the neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue and typically finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, not cost.

3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** This is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that expands the least-cost node first. It always finds the optimal solution if all costs are positive.

4. **A* Search:** This algorithm uses both the actual cost from the start node and a heuristic estimate to the goal to prioritize nodes. The formula used is \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \), where \( g(n) \) is the path cost from the start node to node \( n \), and \( h(n) \) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from \( n \) to the goal.

5. **Best-First (Greedy) Search:** This algorithm uses only the heuristic function to decide which node to expand next, ignoring the actual path cost so far.

Now, let's analyze G3:

- **G3 Tree Structure:**
  - Start at A with a score of 7.
  - Expand A to D with a score of 6.
  - From D, expand to C with a score of 8.
  - Finally, from D, expand to G with a score of 6.

- **Analysis:**
  - The scores next to nodes suggest that the algorithm is considering both path costs and heuristic values. This is characteristic of A* search or Best-First (Greedy) search.
  - The path chosen is A → D → G, with scores indicating consideration beyond just immediate path cost.
  - To determine if it's A* or Greedy, we need to check if the scores align with \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \).

- **Using Heuristic H1:**
  - \( h(A) = 3, h(B) = 6, h(C) = 4, h(D) = 3 \)
  - For A → D:
    - Cost from A to D is 2.
    - \( f(D) = g(D) + h(D) = 2 + 3 = 5 \), but the score shown is 6. This suggests an additional heuristic adjustment or error in scoring.
  - For D → G:
    - Cost from A to D to G is 4.
    - \( f(G) = g(G) + h(G) = 4 + 0 = 4 \), but the score shown is 6, indicating a possible heuristic influence.

- **Using Heuristic H2:**
  - \( h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2 \)
  - For A → D:
    - Cost from A to D is 2.
    - \( f(D) = g(D) + h(D) = 2 + 2 = 4 \), but the score shown is 6.
  - For D → G:
    - Cost from A to D to G is 4.
    - \( f(G) = g(G) + h(G) = 4 + 0 = 4 \), but the score shown is 6.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The scores do not align perfectly with either heuristic, suggesting a possible error or misinterpretation in scoring. However, the use of both path cost and heuristic suggests A* search.
  - Given the scores and the path chosen, it seems more aligned with A* using Heuristic H1, despite discrepancies.

- **Optimality:**
  - The optimal path from A to G is A → B → C → G with a total cost of 5 (1 + 4 + 0).
  - The path found by the algorithm is A → D → G with a total cost of 4.
  - Although the path cost is less, it does not consider all possible paths due to heuristic influence, so it may not be optimal in terms of exploring all possibilities.

**Final Answer for G3:**

1. **Algorithm:** A* Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** H1
3. **Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why:** No, because while the path cost is lower than one possible path, it did not explore all paths due to heuristic influence, potentially missing a more optimal solution in terms of exploration.

- Finally, reach C and then G.

To identify the algorithm used, let's consider the characteristics of each search strategy:

- **Depth First Search (DFS):** Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It doesn't use scores or costs for decision-making.
  
- **Breadth First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It also doesn't consider scores or costs.

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Expands the least-cost node first, using cumulative path cost from the start node as its priority.

- **A* Search:** Uses a combination of path cost and heuristic estimates to prioritize nodes: \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \), where \( g(n) \) is the cost from the start node to node \( n \), and \( h(n) \) is the estimated cost from \( n \) to the goal.

- **Best-first (Greedy) Search:** Expands nodes based solely on a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal, ignoring path costs: \( f(n) = h(n) \).

In G4:
- The scores next to nodes suggest that some form of scoring is being used.
- The transition from A (3) → B and then A (2) → D indicates that the decision to move to D over continuing with B was based on a score, likely involving both path cost and heuristic.

Given this structure, G4 appears to be using **A* Search**. This is because:
- It uses scores that could represent \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \).
- The transition from A (3) → B and then A (2) → D suggests a combination of path cost and heuristic was used, as the score for D is lower than continuing with B.

### 2. Heuristic (if any):
To determine which heuristic might have been used, let's consider the scores:

- From A to D, the score changes from 3 to 2. This suggests a decrease in the estimated total cost.
- The score at D is 0 before moving to C, indicating that reaching C directly from D was considered optimal.

Let's evaluate the heuristics:
- **H1:** \( h(A) = 3, h(B) = 6, h(C) = 4, h(D) = 3 \)
- **H2:** \( h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2 \)

Using H1:
- From A to D: \( f(D) = g(A \to D) + h(D) = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
- From A to B: \( f(B) = g(A \to B) + h(B) = 1 + 6 = 7 \)

Using H2:
- From A to D: \( f(D) = g(A \to D) + h(D) = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
- From A to B: \( f(B) = g(A \to B) + h(B) = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

The score at D being lower than continuing with B suggests H2 was used, as it results in a lower estimated cost for reaching the goal from D.

### 3. Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why?
To determine if G4 found the least-cost path:
- The actual costs are: A to B = 1, B to D = 2, D to C = 0, and C to G = 1.
- Total cost for A → B → D → C → G is \( 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 4 \).

The path found by G4 (A → D → C → G) has a total cost of:
- A to D = 2, D to C = 0, C to G = 1.
- Total cost for A → D → C → G is \( 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 \).

Since the path found by G4 has a lower cost than the alternative path through B, it indeed found the least-cost path.

### Conclusion:
1. **Algorithm:** A* Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** H2: \( h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2 \)
3. **Did it find the least-cost path?** Yes, it found the least-cost path.

This analysis shows that G4 was generated using A* search with heuristic H2 and successfully found the optimal path.

If not, why?
//// ANSWER: To analyze the search tree G5 and determine which algorithm generated it, we need to examine how nodes are expanded based on their scores.

### Tree G5:
- **A (1) → B**
- **A (3) → D**
- **B (5) → C**
- **B (6) → G**
- **B (4) → D**
- **C (1) → G**

#### 1. Algorithm:

Let's evaluate the possible algorithms:

- **Depth First Search (DFS):** Expands the deepest unexpanded node first. DFS would not expand nodes in a way that considers scores or costs, so it is unlikely to be DFS.

- **Breadth First Search (BFS):** Expands all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper. BFS does not consider scores or costs either, so G5 is not generated by BFS.

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Expands the node with the lowest path cost first. The path costs are:
  - A → B: 1 + 5 = 6
  - A → D: 3
  - B → C: 6 + 1 = 7
  - B → G: 6 + 4 = 10
  - B → D: 6 + 4 = 10 (but D is already expanded from A)
  - C → G: 7 + 1 = 8

  UCS would expand nodes in the order of their path costs: A, D, B, C, G. This does not match G5.

- **A* Search:** Expands based on f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost to reach node n and h(n) is a heuristic estimate of the cost from n to the goal.

  Let's check with both heuristics:

  - **H1: {h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3}**
    - A → B: f = 1 + 5 + 6 = 12
    - A → D: f = 3 + 3 = 6
    - B → C: f = 6 + 1 + 4 = 11
    - B → G: f = 6 + 4 + 0 = 10
    - B → D: f = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
    - C → G: f = 7 + 1 + 0 = 8

    Order: A, D, B, C, G. This does not match G5.

  - **H2: {h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2}**
    - A → B: f = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9
    - A → D: f = 3 + 2 = 5
    - B → C: f = 6 + 1 + 0 = 7
    - B → G: f = 6 + 4 + 0 = 10
    - B → D: f = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12
    - C → G: f = 7 + 1 + 0 = 8

    Order: A, D, B, C, G. This does not match G5.

- **Best-first (Greedy) Search:** Expands based on the heuristic value h(n) alone.

  - **H1: {h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3}**
    - A → B: h = 6
    - A → D: h = 3
    - B → C: h = 4
    - B → G: h = 0
    - B → D: h = 3
    - C → G: h = 0

    Order: A, D, B, C, G. This does not match G5.

  - **H2: {h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2}**
    - A → B: h = 3
    - A → D: h = 2
    - B → C: h = 0
    - B → G: h = 0
    - B → D: h = 2
    - C → G: h = 0

    Order: A, D, B, C/G, B/D. This matches the expansion order in G5.

#### Conclusion for G5:

1. **Algorithm:** Best-first (Greedy) Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** H2: {h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2}
3. **Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why?**

   No, G5 did not find the least-cost path. Best-first search using a heuristic does not guarantee optimality because it prioritizes nodes based on estimated cost to goal (heuristic) rather than actual path cost. The optimal path from A to G is A → D → C → G with a total cost of 3 + 1 = 4, but the greedy approach may choose paths that appear promising according to the heuristic without considering the true costs.

This analysis shows why G5 was generated by Best-first search using H2 and why it did not find the optimal path.

Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
//// ANSWER: To determine which algorithm generated the search tree labeled G6 and whether it found an optimal path, let's analyze the structure of G6:

### Structure of G6:
- **A (4) → B**: A is expanded first with a score of 4.
- **B (6) → C**: B is expanded next with a cumulative score of 6.
- **B (7) → D**: Another branch from B with a score of 7.
- **B (7) → G**: Yet another branch from B with a score of 7.
- **A (5) → D**: A is expanded again, this time leading to D with a score of 5.
- **D (4) → C**: D expands to C with a cumulative score of 4.
- **D (6) → G**: D also expands to G with a cumulative score of 6.
- **C (5) → G**: Finally, C expands to G with a cumulative score of 5.

### Analysis:

1. **Algorithm**:
   - The tree shows that nodes are expanded based on their scores, which suggests the use of a cost-based search algorithm rather than purely depth or breadth-first strategies.
   - The scores seem to reflect path costs from A to each node, indicating a focus on cumulative cost rather than heuristic estimates alone.

2. **Heuristic (if any)**:
   - Since the scores align with actual path costs and not heuristic values, this suggests that no heuristic function is being used. Therefore, it is likely an algorithm that relies solely on path costs.
   - The scores for each node correspond to the cumulative cost from A to that node: 
     - A → B = 4
     - A → B → C = 6
     - A → B → D = 7
     - A → B → G = 7
     - A → D = 5
     - A → D → C = 4
     - A → D → G = 6
     - A → B → C → G = 5

3. **Did it find the least-cost path?**:
   - The optimal path from A to G is A → D → G with a total cost of 6.
   - In G6, this path is indeed found (A → D → G with score 6).
   - Therefore, G6 does find an optimal path.

### Conclusion:

1. **Algorithm**: Uniform Cost Search
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path?** Yes, because the path A → D → G with a cost of 6 is found, which is the minimum possible cost to reach G from A.

Uniform Cost Search always expands the node with the lowest cumulative cost first, ensuring that once a goal node is reached, the path used is optimal.

Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G7: A (1) → B A (3) → D B (6) → C B (5) → D B (7) → G D (6) → C D (8) → G D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
//// ANSWER: To determine the algorithm used to generate search tree G7 and analyze its properties, we need to examine the order in which nodes are expanded and consider the scores associated with each node.

### Analysis of G7:

1. **Node Expansion Order:**
   - A (1) → B
   - A (3) → D
   - B (6) → C
   - B (5) → D
   - B (7) → G
   - D (6) → C
   - D (8) → G
   - D (4) → C
   - D (6) → G
   - C (5) → G

2. **Scores:**
   - The scores next to nodes represent the cost from the start node A to that node.

3. **Algorithm Identification:**

   - **Depth First Search (DFS):** DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It does not consider costs or heuristics, and it typically expands the deepest unexpanded node.
     - G7 does not follow this pattern because it considers scores/costs.

   - **Breadth First Search (BFS):** BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue and does not consider costs or heuristics.
     - G7 is not BFS as it expands based on scores, not levels.

   - **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** UCS expands the node with the lowest path cost from the start node. It uses a priority queue to ensure nodes are expanded in order of increasing path cost.
     - In G7, B is expanded before D despite D having a lower score than B when considering the path from A. This suggests it's not UCS.

   - **A* Search:** A* expands nodes based on the sum of the path cost and a heuristic estimate to the goal (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)).
     - If we consider H1 or H2, neither results in the expansion order seen in G7. For example, using H1:
       - f(A) = 1 + 3 = 4
       - f(B) = 5 + 6 = 11
       - f(D) = 4 + 3 = 7
     - A* would expand D before B, which is not the case here.
     - Similarly, using H2:
       - f(A) = 1 + 3 = 4
       - f(B) = 5 + 3 = 8
       - f(D) = 4 + 2 = 6
     - A* would expand D before B, which is not the case here.

   - **Best-First (Greedy) Search:** This search uses only the heuristic to decide which node to expand next.
     - Using H1:
       - h(A) = 3
       - h(B) = 6
       - h(D) = 3
     - Greedy would choose A, then B or D (tie), but not necessarily in the order seen.
     - Using H2:
       - h(A) = 3
       - h(B) = 3
       - h(D) = 2
     - Greedy would expand D before B, which is not consistent with G7.

   - **Conclusion:** The expansion pattern suggests a non-standard approach. However, the order of expansion (B before D) and the scores indicate that it might be using a heuristic similar to Best-First Search but without strictly following either H1 or H2.

4. **Optimality:**
   - The path A → B → C has a cost of 1 + 5 + 1 = 7.
   - The path A → D → C has a cost of 3 + 1 = 4, which is the least-cost path to C.
   - G7 does not find the least-cost path because it expands B before D, leading to a higher-cost path being explored first.

### Conclusion for G7:

1. **Algorithm:** Best-First (Greedy) Search with a non-standard heuristic.
2. **Heuristic (if any):** Non-standard; neither H1 nor H2 fits the expansion order.
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No, it did not find the least-cost path because it expanded B before D, leading to a higher-cost exploration sequence.

This analysis shows that G7 is likely generated by a heuristic-driven search that does not strictly adhere to known heuristics H1 or H2, resulting in a non-optimal path being explored first.
