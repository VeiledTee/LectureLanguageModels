Q: Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G6) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). G6: A (4) → B B (6) → C B (7) → D B (7) → G A (5) → D D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
A: Here's a possible answer:
