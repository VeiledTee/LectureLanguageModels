QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 1. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using breadth-first search in this application.
//// ANSWER: No, the standard alpha-beta algorithm cannot be directly generalized to perform a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer.

### Explanation:
The alpha-beta pruning algorithm is designed specifically for depth-first search (DFS) with pruning capabilities. It works by exploring nodes in the game tree from the root down to a pre-specified depth, evaluating each node based on its position in the tree and the values of previously evaluated nodes. The key aspects that make this possible are:

1. **Depth-First Search**: Alpha-beta explores one branch at a time until it reaches a certain depth or finds a leaf node.
2. **Pruning**: It prunes branches by evaluating upper and lower bounds (alpha and beta) to avoid unnecessary evaluations.

### Breadth-First Exploration:
Breadth-first search (BFS), on the other hand, explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. This approach is fundamentally different from DFS because it does not follow a single path but rather explores all possible paths simultaneously up to a certain depth.

#### Why BFS Cannot Directly Replace Alpha-Beta:
1. **Exploration Order**: BFS would explore all nodes at each level of the tree, which can be computationally expensive for large trees.
2. **Pruning Mechanism**: The pruning mechanism in alpha-beta relies on evaluating nodes along a single path and comparing values to decide whether to continue exploring or prune branches. BFS does not have this sequential evaluation capability.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Breadth-First Search:
#### Disadvantages:
1. **Computational Cost**: BFS explores all nodes at each level, which can be exponentially more computationally expensive than DFS with pruning.
2. **Memory Usage**: BFS requires storing all nodes at the current depth in memory, leading to higher space complexity.

#### Advantages (if any):
1. **Completeness and Optimality**: BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path to a solution if one exists, which might be an advantage in certain scenarios where finding the optimal move is critical.
2. **Parallelism**: BFS can be more amenable to parallel processing since nodes at each level can be evaluated simultaneously.

### Conclusion:
While it is theoretically possible to implement some form of breadth-first search with pruning techniques, this would not leverage the efficiency gains provided by alpha-beta and would likely result in significantly higher computational costs for large game trees. Therefore, the standard alpha-beta algorithm cannot be generalized to perform a breadth-first exploration while still guaranteeing optimal answers.

In practice, the choice between DFS-based algorithms like alpha-beta and BFS depends on the specific requirements of the problem, such as the size of the search space and the need for speed versus completeness.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 2. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application.
//// ANSWER: Yes, alpha-beta pruning can indeed be generalized to perform a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still obtain the optimal answer.

### Progressive-Deepening Alpha-Beta Search

Progressive-deepening alpha-beta search (PDAB) is an extension of the standard alpha-beta algorithm that explores the game tree incrementally, starting from a shallow depth and gradually increasing it. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: PDAB can be more memory-efficient compared to exploring the entire tree up to a fixed depth at once because it only stores nodes relevant to the current search depth.

2. **Flexibility in Time Management**: In scenarios where time is limited, PDAB allows for a trade-off between the depth of exploration and the available time. By stopping early if time runs out, one can still get an optimal solution up to that point.

3. **Optimal Solution Guarantee**: Despite exploring fewer nodes than a full alpha-beta search at each step, PDAB ensures that it will find the same optimal solution as a full search given enough iterations (i.e., increasing depths).

### How Progressive-Deepening Alpha-Beta Works

1. **Initial Depth 0 Search**: Start with an initial depth of 0 and perform a standard alpha-beta search.
2. **Increase Depth Iteratively**: Incrementally increase the search depth by one at each iteration, re-running the algorithm from scratch.
3. **Pruning Continuation**: Use the results from previous iterations to prune branches in subsequent searches. This is possible because nodes evaluated in shallower depths can provide bounds that help prune deeper nodes.

### Advantages of Progressive-Deepening Alpha-Beta

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: PDAB allows for dynamic allocation of computational resources based on time constraints or available memory.
2. **Robustness to Time Constraints**: In real-time applications, PDAB can ensure optimal play within the time limit by stopping at a depth that guarantees an optimal solution.

### Disadvantages of Progressive-Deepening Alpha-Beta

1. **Redundant Work**: Each iteration starts from scratch, potentially evaluating nodes multiple times across different iterations.
2. **Complexity Management**: Managing the transition between depths and ensuring proper pruning can be complex, especially in large or irregular game trees.
3. **Initial Depth Selection**: Choosing an appropriate initial depth can affect performance; too shallow might miss optimal solutions, while too deep could waste resources.

In summary, progressive-deepening alpha-beta search is a viable approach that combines the benefits of both iterative deepening and alpha-beta pruning. While it may involve some redundancy in evaluations, it offers significant advantages in terms of memory efficiency and flexibility in time management, making it suitable for various real-world applications where computational resources are limited or time constraints exist.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: For the given path search problem with a very large branching factor but where the answers involve a relatively short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown) and all actions have the same cost, you should use **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

### Why DFS?
1. **Branching Factor**: The large branching factor means that using Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores nodes level by level, would require a lot of memory to store all the nodes at each level.
2. **Short Sequence Length**: Since the optimal path is relatively short and all actions have the same cost, DFS can quickly find the solution without exploring many unnecessary paths. DFS will explore as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

### When to Use a Visited or Expanded List?
- **Visited List (DFS)**: In this case, using a visited list is essential for DFS. Since DFS explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking, it's crucial to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited to avoid infinite loops and redundant work.
  
  - **Conditions**: Always use a visited or expanded list when implementing DFS to ensure correctness.

- **Expanded List (BFS)**: While not strictly necessary for DFS in this context, maintaining an expanded list can be beneficial. An expanded list keeps track of all nodes that have been processed but are not necessarily the current node being explored. This can help in pruning unnecessary branches and ensuring a more systematic exploration.
  
  - **Conditions**: Using an expanded list is generally good practice to avoid revisiting nodes and ensure efficient backtracking.

### Summary
- **Search Algorithm**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Visited List**: Always use a visited or expanded list to prevent infinite loops and redundant work, especially in DFS where the risk of revisiting nodes is higher due to its nature of exploring as deep as possible before backtracking.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: For the given path search problem with a very large branching factor but where the answers involve a relatively short sequence of actions and have widely varying costs, you should use **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)**. Here's why:

### 1. IDA* Algorithm Choice

- **Large Branching Factor**: The large branching factor means that breadth-first search or uniform-cost search would be inefficient due to the exponential growth in the number of nodes explored.
- **Short Sequence of Actions**: Since the optimal solution involves a relatively short sequence, algorithms like A* can be effective as they prioritize paths based on an evaluation function (heuristic + cost).
- **Widely Varying Costs**: IDA* is particularly well-suited for problems with varying costs because it uses a cutoff value to limit the depth of exploration. This allows it to efficiently search through the space without getting stuck in deep, costly branches.

### 2. Why Not Other Algorithms?

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS can be very inefficient due to its potential to explore deep paths that are not optimal.
- **Uniform-Cost Search**: While effective for problems with consistent costs, it is not efficient when the cost of actions varies widely and unpredictably.
- **A* Algorithm**: A* is a good choice but might require a heuristic function. IDA*, on the other hand, does not need an explicit heuristic because it uses repeated depth-limited searches.

### 3. Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)

- **Combination of Depth-First and Breadth-First**: IDA* combines the efficiency of depth-first search with the completeness and optimality guarantees of breadth-first search.
- **Depth-Limited Search**: In each iteration, it performs a depth-limited search up to a certain cost limit. If no solution is found within this limit, the limit is increased, and the process repeats until the optimal path is found.
- **Optimality**: IDA* guarantees finding the optimal path if one exists.

### 4. Visited or Expanded List

In this scenario, maintaining a visited or expanded list would be beneficial for several reasons:

- **Avoiding Repeated Work**: By keeping track of nodes that have already been explored, you can avoid redundant work and improve efficiency.
- **Pruning Unnecessary Paths**: If the cost function is such that certain paths are consistently more expensive, knowing which nodes have been visited can help in pruning these paths early.

### Conclusion

Use **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)** for this problem. Maintaining a visited or expanded list would be a good idea to avoid redundant work and improve efficiency, especially when dealing with varying costs and large branching factors.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: To answer this question, let's first understand the problem and then apply the concept of constraint propagation.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have a 3x3 checkerboard with five squares numbered as follows:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 |
```

- The goal is to assign colors (red R or black B) such that no two adjacent squares share the same color.
- Constraint propagation will be applied to determine if any domains can be reduced based on the constraints.

### Initial State:
Initially, all variables have a domain of {R, B}:

- Square 1: Domain = {R, B}
- Square 2: Domain = {R, B}
- Square 3: Domain = {R, B}
- Square 4: Domain = {R, B}
- Square 5: Domain = {R, B}

### Constraint Propagation:
Constraint propagation involves checking the constraints (adjacency) and reducing domains if a variable's value can be determined based on these constraints.

1. **Square 2 is adjacent to Square 1**: 
   - If Square 1 is assigned R, then Square 2 must be B.
   - If Square 1 is assigned B, then Square 2 must be R.
   - Therefore, the domain of Square 2 can be reduced based on the value of Square 1.

2. **Square 3 is adjacent to Square 2**:
   - Similarly, if Square 2's domain changes due to the value of Square 1, then Square 3's domain will also change.
   - If Square 2 is R, then Square 3 must be B.
   - If Square 2 is B, then Square 3 must be R.
   - Therefore, the domain of Square 3 can be reduced based on the value of Square 2.

3. **Square 4 is adjacent to Square 1**:
   - The same logic applies: if Square 1's domain changes, then Square 4's domain will also change.
   - If Square 1 is R, then Square 4 must be B.
   - If Square 1 is B, then Square 4 must be R.

4. **Square 5 is adjacent to Square 4**:
   - The same logic applies: if Square 4's domain changes due to the value of Square 1, then Square 5's domain will also change.
   - If Square 4 is R, then Square 5 must be B.
   - If Square 4 is B, then Square 5 must be R.

### Full Constraint Propagation:
Given that all adjacent squares have opposite colors, we can propagate the constraints fully. Let's assume an initial assignment (though any valid assignment will work due to symmetry):

- Assign Square 1: R
- Then, Square 2: B
- Then, Square 3: R
- Then, Square 4: B
- Then, Square 5: R

After full constraint propagation:

- **Square 1**: Domain = {R}
- **Square 2**: Domain = {B}
- **Square 3**: Domain = {R}
- **Square 4**: Domain = {B}
- **Square 5**: Domain = {R}

### Conclusion:
The resulting domains after full constraint propagation are:

- Square 1: Domain = {R}
- Square 2: Domain = {B}
- Square 3: Domain = {R}
- Square 4: Domain = {B}
- Square 5: Domain = {R}

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: Given the constraints and the initial domain restrictions for variable 5, let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Initial Setup:
- We have a 3x3 checkerboard with squares numbered as follows:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
     7
```

- Variables: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Domains for all variables initially are {R, B}, except variable 5 which is restricted to {B}.

### Constraint Propagation:
The constraints state that adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) cannot have the same color. We will apply constraint propagation starting with the restriction on variable 5.

1. **Variable 5 = B**: Since square 5 must be black, we can propagate this information to its adjacent squares.
2. **Square 4 and Square 6**:
   - Square 4 is horizontally adjacent to Square 5. Therefore, Square 4 cannot be black (B). Its domain becomes {R}.
   - Square 6 is also horizontally adjacent to Square 5. Similarly, Square 6 cannot be black (B). Its domain becomes {R}.

3. **Square 2**:
   - Square 2 is vertically adjacent to Square 5. Therefore, Square 2 cannot be black (B). Its domain becomes {R}.

4. **Square 3 and Square 7**:
   - Since there are no direct constraints from variable 5 on Squares 3 and 7 initially, their domains remain {R, B}.

### Resulting Domains After Full Constraint Propagation:

- Variable 1: {R, B}
- Variable 2: {R}
- Variable 3: {R, B}
- Variable 4: {R}
- Variable 5: {B}
- Variable 6: {R}
- Variable 7: {R, B}

### Summary:
After applying full constraint propagation given the initial restriction on variable 5, the resulting domains of the variables are as follows:

1. Domain of Square 1: {R, B}
2. Domain of Square 2: {R}
3. Domain of Square 3: {R, B}
4. Domain of Square 4: {R}
5. Domain of Square 5: {B}
6. Domain of Square 6: {R}
7. Domain of Square 7: {R, B}

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables?
//// ANSWER: In this problem, we need to apply forward checking after assigning variable 1 (square 1) to the value "R" (red). Forward checking is a technique used in constraint satisfaction problems that involves maintaining and updating the domains of unassigned variables based on the assignments made. Here's how it works step-by-step:

### Initial State
- Variables: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Domains for all variables: {R, B}

### Assignment
- Assign variable 1 (square 1) to R.

### Adjacent Squares and Constraints
The adjacent squares of square 1 are:
- Square 2 (horizontally adjacent)
- Square 4 (vertically adjacent)

According to the problem constraints, no two adjacent squares can have the same color. Therefore, after assigning variable 1 to R, we need to update the domains of its adjacent variables.

### Forward Checking
1. **Square 2**:
   - Variable 2 is horizontally adjacent to square 1.
   - Since square 1 is assigned R, square 2 cannot be R.
   - Domain for square 2: {B}

2. **Square 4**:
   - Variable 4 is vertically adjacent to square 1.
   - Since square 1 is assigned R, square 4 cannot be R.
   - Domain for square 4: {B}

3. **Squares 3 and 5**:
   - Squares 3 and 5 are not directly adjacent to square 1.
   - Their domains remain unchanged as they do not violate any constraints with the current assignment of square 1.
   - Domains for squares 3 and 5: {R, B}

### Resulting Domains
- Domain of variable 2 (square 2): {B}
- Domain of variable 4 (square 4): {B}
- Domain of variable 3 (square 3): {R, B}
- Domain of variable 5 (square 5): {R, B}

### Summary
After assigning square 1 to R and performing forward checking:
- The domain for square 2 is {B}.
- The domain for square 4 is {B}.
- The domains for squares 3 and 5 remain {R, B}.

Thus, the resulting domains of the other variables are:
- Square 2: {B}
- Square 3: {R, B}
- Square 4: {B}
- Square 5: {R, B}

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored. RB RBRB RBRBRBRB RBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem, we need to follow the constraints and the order of variable assignment as described. Let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Variables are squares 1 through 5.
   - Domain for variables 1, 2, 3, and 4 is {R, B}.
   - Domain for variable 5 is {B}.

2. **Backtracking Search Order:**
   - We start with variable 1 (square 1) and assign it to R or B.
   - If the assignment fails a constraint test, we backtrack and try the other value.
   - Then move on to variable 2 (square 2), and so forth.

3. **Constraint Test:**
   - Squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally must not have the same color.

4. **Tree Representation:**

Given the tree structure provided:

```
RB RBRB RBRBRBRB RBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
```

Let's mark and cross out nodes based on the pure backtracking (BT) process, considering the constraints and the given domains.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Assign Variable 1:**
   - Assign R to variable 1.
     - Node: RB
       - Check constraint with adjacent squares (2 and 4).
         - Square 2 must be B.
         - Square 4 must be B.
       - Valid assignment, proceed.

2. **Assign Variable 2:**
   - Assign B to variable 2.
     - Node: RBRB
       - Check constraint with adjacent squares (1 and 3).
         - Constraint satisfied.
       - Valid assignment, proceed.

3. **Assign Variable 3:**
   - Assign B to variable 3.
     - Node: RBRBB
       - Check constraint with adjacent squares (2 and 5).
         - Square 5 must be B (given domain).
         - Constraint satisfied.
       - Valid assignment, proceed.

4. **Assign Variable 4:**
   - Assign B to variable 4.
     - Node: RBRBBB
       - Check constraint with adjacent squares (1 and 5).
         - Constraint satisfied.
       - Valid assignment, proceed.

5. **Assign Variable 5:**
   - Domain for variable 5 is {B}.
     - Node: RBRBBB
       - No need to check constraints as the domain only allows B.
       - Valid assignment, complete solution found.

### Tree with Marks and Crossouts:

```
RB (✓) RBRB (✓) RBRBB (✓) RBRBBB (✓)
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB (✗)
```

- **Marked Nodes:**
  - RB
  - RBRB
  - RBRBB
  - RBRBBB

- **Crossed Out Node:**
  - BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB (This node would never be explored because it violates the constraint with square 5.)

The pure backtracking search proceeds by marking valid assignments and crossing out nodes where a constraint test fails. The final solution is `RBRBB`.

Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None    | 1 = R   | 2= B   | 1= B    | 2= R   | 3= B   | 4= R   | 5= B   | |---------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R,B } |         |        |         |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R,B } | { B }   |        | { R }   |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R,B } | { R,B } | { R }  | { R,B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R,B } | { B }   | { B }  | { R }   | { R }  | { R }  |        |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }   | { B }   | {} ⇓   | { B }   | { B }  | { B }  | { B }  |        |
//// ANSWER: Given the constraints and using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC), we will follow a sequence of assignments that respect the rules for coloring adjacent squares differently. The initial domains are all {R, B} for each variable. Here is the list of all assignments attempted in sequence:

1. **Assignment: 1 = R**
   - Domain of 1: {R, B}
   
2. **Assignment: 2 = B**
   - Domain of 2: {B}

3. **Assignment: 3 = B**
   - Domain of 3: {R, B} (but forward checking removes B because 2 is B)

4. **Assignment: 4 = R**
   - Domain of 4: {B} (but forward checking removes B because 1 and 5 are R)
   
5. **Assignment: 5 = B**
   - Domain of 5: {} (fails, backtracking occurs)

Since the domain of variable 5 becomes empty, we backtrack to the previous assignment:

6. Backtrack to 4th assignment:
   - Reassign 4 = B
   - Domain of 4: {B}

7. **Assignment: 5 = R**
   - Domain of 5: {R} (but forward checking removes R because 1 and 3 are R)

Since the domain of variable 5 again becomes empty, we backtrack further:

8. Backtrack to 3rd assignment:
   - Reassign 3 = R
   - Domain of 3: {R}

9. **Assignment: 4 = B**
   - Domain of 4: {B} (but forward checking removes B because 1 is R)

Since the domain of variable 4 again becomes empty, we backtrack further:

10. Backtrack to 2nd assignment:
    - Reassign 2 = R
    - Domain of 2: {R}

11. **Assignment: 3 = R**
    - Domain of 3: {R} (but forward checking removes R because 2 is R)

Since the domain of variable 3 again becomes empty, we backtrack further:

12. Backtrack to 1st assignment:
    - Reassign 1 = B
    - Domain of 1: {B}

13. **Assignment: 2 = R**
    - Domain of 2: {R} (but forward checking removes R because 1 is B)

Since the domain of variable 2 again becomes empty, we backtrack further:

14. Backtrack to initial state:
    - Reassign 1 = R
    - Domain of 1: {R}

15. **Assignment: 2 = B**
    - Domain of 2: {B} (but forward checking removes B because 1 is R)

Since the domain of variable 2 again becomes empty, we backtrack further:

16. Backtrack to initial state:
    - Reassign 1 = B
    - Domain of 1: {B}

17. **Assignment: 2 = R**
    - Domain of 2: {R} (but forward checking removes R because 1 is B)

Since the domain of variable 2 again becomes empty, we backtrack further:

18. Backtrack to initial state:
    - Reassign 1 = R
    - Domain of 1: {R}

This process continues until a valid assignment is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

The sequence of assignments attempted in this BT-FC approach is as follows:

1. 1 = R
2. 2 = B
3. 3 = B
4. 4 = R
5. 5 = B (fails, backtracks)
6. 4 = B
7. 5 = R
8. 3 = R (fails, backtracks)

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 6. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) but with dynamic variable ordering, using the most-constrained-variable strategy, give a list of all the variable assignments attempted, in sequence. If there is a tie between variables, use the lowest-numbered one first.

//// ANSWER: To solve the problem using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) and dynamic variable ordering based on the most-constrained-variable strategy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Domains for each variable: {R, B}
   - Constraints: Adjacent squares cannot have the same color.

2. **Dynamic Variable Ordering**:
   - The most-constrained-variable strategy means we choose the variable with the smallest domain first.
   - In this case, all variables initially have a domain of {R, B}, so we will use the lowest-numbered one in case of ties.

3. **Backtracking Process**:

Let's go through each step and list the assignments attempted, along with their domains after each assignment:

- **Initial State**: All squares are unassigned.
  
  | Assignment:   | None     |
  |---------------|----------|
  | Domain of 1:  | { R, B } |
  | Domain of 2:  | { R, B } |
  | Domain of 3:  | { R, B } |
  | Domain of 4:  | { R, B } |
  | Domain of 5:  | { R, B } |

- **Step 1**: Assign variable 1.
  
  - Choose the most-constrained-variable (all have equal constraints), so we choose the lowest-numbered one first.

  | Assignment:   | 1 = R    |
  |---------------|----------|
  | Domain of 1:  | {R}      |
  | Domain of 2:  | {B}      |
  | Domain of 3:  | {B}      |
  | Domain of 4:  | {B}      |
  | Domain of 5:  | {B}      |

- **Step 2**: Assign variable 2.
  
  - Variable 2 is constrained by variable 1 (adjacent horizontally).

  | Assignment:   | 1 = R, 2 = B |
  |---------------|--------------|
  | Domain of 1:  | {R}          |
  | Domain of 2:  | {B}          |
  | Domain of 3:  | {R}          |
  | Domain of 4:  | {R}          |
  | Domain of 5:  | {R}          |

- **Step 3**: Assign variable 3.
  
  - Variable 3 is constrained by variables 1 and 2 (adjacent vertically).

  | Assignment:   | 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R |
  |---------------|---------------------|
  | Domain of 1:  | {R}                 |
  | Domain of 2:  | {B}                 |

  | Domain of 4:  | {R}                 |
  | Domain of 5:  | {R}                 |

- **Step 4**: Assign variable 4.
  
  - Variable 4 is constrained by variables 2 and 5 (adjacent horizontally).

  | Assignment:   | 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R, 4 = B |
  |---------------|----------------------------|
  | Domain of 1:  | {R}                        |
  | Domain of 2:  | {B}                        |
  | Domain of 3:  | {R}                        |
  | Domain of 4:  | {B}                        |
  | Domain of 5:  | {B}                        |

- **Step 5**: Assign variable 5.
  
  - Variable 5 is constrained by variables 2 and 4 (adjacent vertically).

  | Assignment:   | 1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R, 4 = B, 5 = B |
  |---------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Domain of 1:  | {R}                               |
  | Domain of 2:  | {B}                               |
  | Domain of 3:  | {R}                               |
  | Domain of 4:  | {B}                               |
  | Domain of 5:  | {B}                               |

The final assignment is:
1 = R, 2 = B, 3 = R, 4 = B, 5 = B

This sequence represents all the variable assignments attempted using backtracking with forward checking and dynamic variable ordering based on the most-constrained-variable strategy.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: ### Formulation A: The Variables Are the 3k Instrument/Time Slots

#### 1. Value Domain for the Variables
Each variable represents an assignment of a scientist's observation to a specific time slot and instrument. Since each observation is defined by a target, an instrument, and a time slot, and there are \(m\) scientists with \(n\) observations each, we need to assign exactly two out of these \(mn\) requests for each scientist.

The domain for each variable (instrument/time slot) can be described as follows:
- Each variable must take on one value from the set of all possible observations. 
- Since there are \(m \times n\) total observations and only 2 out of these need to be assigned per scientist, we ensure that exactly two values are chosen for each scientist's variables.

#### 2. Size of the Domain
The domain size is not straightforwardly defined by \(k\), \(m\), or \(n\) alone because it depends on how many valid assignments (observations) can be made to satisfy constraints C1, C2, and C3. However, we can say that each variable's domain includes all possible observations for a given time slot and instrument.

#### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied
- **C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
  - This constraint is inherently satisfied by the formulation because each variable represents an assignment to a specific time slot and instrument, ensuring that no more than one observation can be assigned to any given instrument/time slot combination.

#### 4. Binary Constraints
- **C1**: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
  - This constraint cannot be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation because it involves a selection of exactly two out of \(n\) possible values for each scientist, which is inherently a combinatorial problem.

- **C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
  - This can be partially specified using binary constraints. For example, if we introduce auxiliary variables to track the targets at each time slot and use binary constraints to ensure that all assigned observations share the same target value.

### Example of Binary Constraints for C3
To specify constraint C3 as a binary constraint:
- Introduce an auxiliary variable \(T_{t}\) for each time slot \(t\) representing the target.
- Use binary constraints such as \((O_i, T_t)\) where \(O_i\) is an observation and \(T_t\) is the target at time slot \(t\), ensuring that if \(O_i\) is assigned to time slot \(t\), then \(T_t = t_{O_i}\).

### Summary for Formulation A
- **Value Domain**: Each variable represents a specific observation.
- **Domain Size**: Not straightforwardly defined but includes all possible observations.
- **Constraints Satisfied**: C2 (inherently satisfied).
- **Binary Constraints**: C3 can be partially specified using auxiliary variables and binary constraints, while C1 cannot be directly specified as binary constraints.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation A: The variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots.

1. **Value Domain for Variables**:
   - Each variable represents an assignment of one of the three instruments (let's call them I1, I2, and I3) to a specific time slot.
   - Therefore, the value domain for each variable is \(\{I1, I2, I3\}\).

2. **Size of Domain**:
   - The size of the domain for each variable is 3.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation**:
   - Constraint C2: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
     - This constraint is necessarily satisfied because each variable represents an assignment to a specific time slot and only one value (instrument) can be assigned to it at any given time.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification**:
   - Yes, the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation.
     - For Constraint C2: We can define a binary constraint for each pair of variables representing different instruments that are scheduled in the same time slot. This ensures that only one instrument is assigned to any given time slot.

Here's how we can specify these binary constraints:
- For every pair \((i, j)\) where \(i\) and \(j\) represent different instruments (e.g., I1 and I2), and for each time slot \(t\):
  - Define a binary constraint that ensures at most one of the variables representing instrument \(i\) or \(j\) can be assigned to time slot \(t\).

For example, if we have two variables \(x_{I1,t}\) and \(x_{I2,t}\), where both represent whether I1 or I2 is scheduled in time slot \(t\):
- The binary constraint would ensure that \((x_{I1,t} = 1) \rightarrow (x_{I2,t} = 0)\) and \((x_{I2,t} = 1) \rightarrow (x_{I1,t} = 0)\).

This formulation effectively captures the essence of Constraint C2 by ensuring that only one instrument is assigned to any given time slot.

The other constraints, such as C1 and C3, would need additional formulations or constraints beyond just this binary constraint approach.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 3. Satisfied constraints:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation A: The variables are the 3k instrument/time slots.

1. **Value Domain for Variables**: Each variable represents a specific combination of an instrument and a time slot. Therefore, each variable can take on one of three values corresponding to the three instruments (let's denote them as I1, I2, I3).

2. **Size of the Domain for Variables**: Since there are 3k such variables (one for each instrument/time slot), and each has a domain size of 3, the total number of possible assignments is \(3^{3k}\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied**:
   - **C1**: This constraint cannot be directly satisfied by this formulation because it requires selecting exactly two observations per scientist, which involves variables beyond just the instrument/time slots.
   - **C2 and C3**: These constraints can be indirectly satisfied due to the nature of the problem. Since each time slot can only have one observation for a given instrument (C2) and all observations in a single time slot must share the same target (C3), these constraints are inherently respected by the structure of the formulation.

4. **Binary Constraints**:
   - **C2**: Yes, C2 can be specified as binary constraints. For each combination of an instrument and a time slot, we can create a binary constraint that ensures at most one observation is scheduled for that specific combination.
   - **C3**: No, C3 cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint in this formulation. A binary constraint involves two variables, but C3 requires considering all observations within the same time slot, which involves more than two variables.

Here's an explanation of how to specify C2 as binary constraints:
- For each instrument \(i\) and time slot \(t\), create a binary variable \(x_{it}\) that is 1 if an observation for that combination is scheduled, and 0 otherwise.
- Add the constraint \(\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{it} \leq 1\) for each time slot \(t\). This ensures at most one instrument is used in any given time slot.

For C3, a counterexample to show it cannot be specified as binary constraints:
Consider three scientists with the following requests (targets are represented by T1, T2):
- Scientist 1: (T1, I1), (T1, I2)
- Scientist 2: (T2, I1), (T2, I3)
- Scientist 3: (T1, I3), (T2, I2)

In this case, if we try to schedule the first observation of each scientist in a binary constraint context, it would be impossible to ensure that all observations for a single time slot share the same target without considering multiple variables together.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation A, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots:

1. **Value Domain for Variables**: Each variable represents an assignment of a specific observation to one of the three instruments in a given time slot. The value domain for each variable is thus the set of all possible observations that can be assigned.

2. **Size of the Domain for Variables**: Since there are \(m\) scientists and each has submitted \(n\) observations, the total number of possible observations is \(mn\). Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable is \(mn\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied**:
   - Constraint C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot) will be inherently satisfied because each variable in this formulation represents an assignment to a specific instrument/time slot combination.
   
4. **Binary Constraints**: Yes, the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation.

### Explanation for Binary Constraints:

- **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made)**: This constraint can be enforced using a combination of unary and binary constraints. For each scientist \(i\), we can introduce additional variables to count the number of selected observations, ensuring that exactly 2 out of their \(n\) requests are chosen. However, this is more complex than necessary for binary constraints.

- **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target)**: This constraint can be enforced using binary constraints by ensuring that if two different observations are assigned to the same instrument/time slot, they must share the same target. For each pair of variables representing different instruments/time slots, we can add a binary constraint that ensures their targets are equal.

### Example Binary Constraint for C3:
For any time slot \(t\) and instruments \(i, j\), if \(x_{t,i}\) represents an observation assigned to instrument \(i\) at time slot \(t\) and \(x_{t,j}\) represents an observation assigned to instrument \(j\) at the same time slot \(t\), we can add a binary constraint:
\[ \text{if } x_{t,i} \neq 0 \text{ and } x_{t,j} \neq 0, \text{ then } T(x_{t,i}) = T(x_{t,j}) \]
where \(T(\cdot)\) is the target function.

This formulation ensures that if two different observations are scheduled for the same time slot, they must have the same target. This approach effectively captures Constraint C3 using binary constraints.

Thus, Formulation A can indeed specify all necessary constraints as binary constraints by appropriately defining and adding these constraints between variables representing different instrument/time slots.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation B where the variables are the \(m\) scientists:

1. **Domain:** 
   - Each variable (scientist) can be assigned a subset of their observations. Specifically, each scientist must have exactly two observations selected from their list of \(n\) requests.
   
2. **Size of the domain for the variables:**
   - The size of the domain for each scientist is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), since we are choosing 2 out of \(n\) observations.

3. **Constraints necessarily satisfied because of the formulation:**
   - C3 (the observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is not directly enforced by this formulation, as it does not specify which observations are selected or how they are grouped into time slots.
   
4. **Whether constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation:**
   - Constraints C1 and C2 cannot be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation because the variables represent scientists rather than individual time slot-instrument assignments. 
     - **Counterexample for C1:** Consider two scientists, each with three observations. If we try to specify a binary constraint that exactly one of their observations is selected, it would not necessarily ensure that both scientists get exactly two observations.
     - **Counterexample for C2:** A binary constraint between two scientists' variables cannot enforce the rule that at most one observation per instrument per time slot can be scheduled. This requires information about the specific time slots and instruments involved.

In summary, Formulation B does not directly support specifying constraints C1 and C2 as binary constraints due to its focus on selecting observations from each scientist's list rather than assigning them to specific time slots and instruments.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation B where the variables are the \(m\) scientists:

1. **Value Domain for Variables**: 
   - Each scientist can be assigned a subset of their observations, specifically two out of their \(n\) requested observations.

2. **Size of the Domain**:
   - The size of the domain for each variable (scientist) is \(\binom{n}{2}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 observations from \(n\). This can be expressed as \(\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied**:
   - Constraint C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot) is not necessarily satisfied because the variables here are scientists, and there's no direct representation of instruments or time slots in this formulation.
   - Constraint C3 (observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is also not directly represented as it involves both time slots and targets which are not part of the scientist variables.

4. **Binary Constraints**:
   - The constraints cannot be specified as binary constraints in this formulation because each constraint would need to involve interactions between scientists, instruments, and time slots, but these elements are not present in the variable domain.
   
To illustrate with a counterexample, consider \(m = 2\) scientists, each with two observations. If we try to represent this using only the scientist variables, there's no way to enforce that exactly one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled since the formulation does not include any representation of instruments or time slots.

In summary, Formulation B cannot directly specify constraints C2 and C3 as binary constraints due to the lack of necessary elements in the variable domain.

The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation B where the variables are the \(m\) scientists:

1. **Value Domain for Variables**:
   - Each variable (scientist) can be assigned a subset of their observations, specifically two out of their \(n\) observations.

2. **Size of the Domain for Variables**:
   - The size of the domain for each scientist's variable is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), as we are choosing 2 out of \(n\) observations from each scientist.

3. **Satisfied Constraints**:
   - Constraint C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot) is not necessarily satisfied because the variables in this formulation do not directly represent the time slots or instruments.
   - Constraint C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is also not necessarily satisfied as the variables here are scientists, and there's no direct representation of time slots or targets.

4. **Binary Constraints**:
   - The constraints cannot be specified as binary constraints in this formulation.
     - **Counterexample**: Consider two scientists \(S_1\) and \(S_2\), each with 3 observations: \(\{O_{1,1}, O_{1,2}, O_{1,3}\}\) for \(S_1\) and \(\{O_{2,1}, O_{2,2}, O_{2,3}\}\) for \(S_2\). If we try to represent this using binary constraints, we would need a constraint that ensures both of \(S_1\)'s chosen observations are different from each other and similarly for \(S_2\), but there's no way to enforce the constraints between scientists' choices without additional variables or constraints.

In summary, Formulation B does not directly satisfy Constraints C2 and C3 due to its focus on scientists rather than time slots or targets. Additionally, it is challenging to represent these constraints as binary constraints within this formulation.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation B where the variables are the \(m\) scientists:

1. **The value domain for the variables**: Each variable (scientist) can be assigned a subset of their observations, specifically two out of their \(n\) requests.

2. **The size of the domain for the variables**: The domain size is \(\binom{n}{2}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 observations from each scientist's list of \(n\) requests. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Domain Size} = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Which constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation**: None of the given constraints (C1, C2, or C3) are necessarily satisfied by this formulation alone. The formulation only specifies which observations each scientist's variables can take on; it does not inherently enforce any scheduling constraints.

4. **Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation**:
   - **Constraint C1**: This constraint cannot be directly enforced through binary constraints because it requires choosing exactly two out of \(n\) requests for each scientist, which is a combinatorial selection problem.
   - **Constraint C2**: This constraint can potentially be expressed using binary constraints. For example, if we introduce binary variables indicating whether a particular observation from a scientist's list is selected or not, and ensure that the sum of these binary variables equals 2 for each scientist, this would enforce Constraint C1 indirectly but directly address part of Constraint C2.
   - **Constraint C3**: This constraint cannot be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. It requires ensuring that all selected observations at a given time slot share the same target, which involves checking multiple variables simultaneously and is not a simple pairwise relationship.

To illustrate why some constraints cannot be directly expressed as binary constraints:
- Consider Constraint C1: Selecting exactly two out of \(n\) requests for each scientist can't be directly enforced by binary constraints alone. You would need to use more complex constraint satisfaction techniques or introduce additional variables.
- Constraint C3 involves ensuring that all selected observations at a given time slot share the same target, which requires checking multiple variables (one per observation) and is not a simple pairwise relationship.

In summary, while some aspects of the problem can be addressed using binary constraints in Formulation B, full satisfaction of all constraints would require more sophisticated constraint handling.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests:

1. **Domain:** 
   - Each variable (scientist's request) can take on one of two values: "selected" or "not selected". This is because exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made, and we need to decide which two out of the \(n\) requests are chosen.

2. **Size of the domain for the variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\)):**
   - The size of the domain is 2 because there are only two possible states: selected or not selected.
   
3. **Constraints necessarily satisfied due to the formulation:**
   - C1: This constraint can be naturally enforced by ensuring that exactly two out of the \(n\) requests for each scientist are selected. Since we have formulated variables as individual requests, this can be directly managed through constraints on the selection process.

4. **Binary constraints specification:**
   - Yes, the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation.
   
   **Explanation:**
   - For C1, we can use a cardinality constraint to ensure that exactly two out of \(n\) requests for each scientist are selected. This is a binary constraint on the selection process.
   - For C2 and C3, these can be enforced through additional constraints between the variables representing different time slots and instruments. Specifically:
     - **C2:** We need to ensure that at most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. This can be achieved by adding a binary constraint for each combination of an instrument and a time slot, ensuring that no more than one request is selected for any given instrument-time slot pair.
     - **C3:** The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. We can enforce this by adding constraints between the variables representing different scientists' requests at the same time slot to ensure they share the same target.

   **Counterexample for non-binary formulation:**
   - Formulation C inherently deals with binary choices (selecting or not selecting each request), making it straightforward to express all given constraints as binary constraints. There is no need for a counterexample here since the problem can be directly addressed using binary constraints in this formulation.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests:

1. **Value Domain for Variables**: Each variable represents a request from one of the \(m\) scientists and can take on values corresponding to any combination of target, instrument, and time slot.

2. **Size of the Domain for Variables**:
   - Since there are \(k\) time slots, 3 instruments, and each observation is specified by a unique combination of these (target, instrument, time slot), the domain size for each variable can be considered as \(3k\). This is because for any given target-time slot pair, there are 3 possible instruments.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied**:
   - **C1**: This constraint cannot be directly enforced by the formulation since it requires selecting exactly two observations per scientist from their list of requests. The formulation does not inherently ensure that only two specific requests are chosen.
   - **C2 & C3**: These constraints can be indirectly satisfied through the structure of the problem, but they need to be explicitly defined as part of the constraint satisfaction process.

4. **Binary Constraints**:
   - **C1**: Cannot be specified as binary constraints in this formulation because it involves a selection from multiple options (choosing 2 out of \(n\) requests per scientist).
   - **C2 & C3**: Can potentially be specified as binary constraints but require careful definition.
     - For **C2**, we can define binary variables indicating whether an observation is scheduled at a specific time slot for each instrument. This would involve creating additional auxiliary variables and constraints to ensure that only one of these binary variables is true per instrument-time slot combination.
     - For **C3**, similar binary variables could be used, with the constraint ensuring that all selected observations at a given time slot share the same target.

**Counterexample for C1**:
Consider \(m = 2\) scientists and \(n = 2\) requests each. If both scientists have identical requests (e.g., Target A, Instrument 1, Time Slot 1; Target B, Instrument 2, Time Slot 1), Formulation C cannot enforce that exactly two observations are selected from these four requests without additional constraints.

In summary, while the formulation can be structured to accommodate some of the constraints through auxiliary variables and binary constraints, it does not inherently satisfy them.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation C where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests:

1. **Value Domain for Variables**: Each variable represents a scientist's request, and each request can be either scheduled or not scheduled. Therefore, the value domain is \(\{0, 1\}\), where 0 means the observation is not selected, and 1 means it is selected.

2. **Size of the Domain for Variables**: Since there are \(mn\) variables (one for each scientist's request) and each can take one of two values (0 or 1), the domain size for each variable is 2.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation**:
   - **C1**: This constraint cannot be directly enforced by this formulation because it requires selecting exactly two observations per scientist, which involves a choice that isn't naturally represented in a binary domain.
   
4. **Whether Constraints Can Be Specified as Binary Constraints**:
   - **C2 and C3**: These constraints can indeed be specified using binary constraints.

### Explanation for C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):
- For each of the \(k\) time slots, there are 3 instruments. Therefore, a binary constraint can be defined to ensure that at most one of these three variables is set to 1.
- **Binary Constraint Example**: For a given time slot \(t\), and for each of the 3 instruments \(i \in \{1, 2, 3\}\), we define a binary constraint such that:
  - If instrument \(i\) at time slot \(t\) is selected (variable = 1), then all other instruments at the same time slot must be unselected (variables = 0).

### Explanation for C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):
- This constraint can also be enforced using binary constraints.
- For each time slot \(t\), we define a variable that represents the target. Then, for each observation request at that time slot, we enforce a binary constraint such that if an observation is selected (variable = 1), it must have the same target as the defined target variable for that time slot.

### Counterexample for C1:
- **C1** cannot be enforced directly in this formulation because selecting exactly two observations per scientist involves a choice problem which isn't naturally represented by binary constraints. For example, if we try to enforce \(x_{ij} + x_{ik} = 2\) (where \(x_{ij}\) and \(x_{ik}\) are variables for the same scientist's requests), this is not directly expressible as a simple binary constraint.

In summary, Formulation C can effectively represent constraints C2 and C3 using binary constraints but cannot enforce C1 due to its nature involving multiple choices per scientist.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation C where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests:

1. **The value domain for the variables**: Each variable represents a scientist's request, which can be either "selected" or "not selected." Therefore, the value domain is \(\{0, 1\}\), where 1 indicates that the observation is scheduled and 0 indicates it is not.

2. **The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\))**: Since each variable can take on one of two values (selected or not selected), the size of the domain for each variable is 2, regardless of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\).

3. **Which constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation**: The constraint C1 ("Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made") cannot be directly enforced by this formulation alone. Each scientist has multiple requests, but Formulation C does not inherently enforce that exactly two out of these must be selected.

4. **Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation**: The constraints C2 and C3 can potentially be specified as binary constraints, but with some limitations:

   - **Constraint C2 ("At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled")**:
     This constraint can indeed be specified as a set of binary constraints. For each time slot \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq k\)), and for each combination of an instrument \(i\) (where \(i = 1, 2, 3\)) and a scientist \(s\) (where \(1 \leq s \leq m\)), we can create a binary constraint that ensures at most one observation is selected. Specifically, if the variable representing the request from scientist \(s\) for target \(t_i\) with instrument \(i\) is denoted as \(x_{s,t_i,i}\), then we can add constraints like:
     \[
     x_{s_1, t_1, i} + x_{s_2, t_1, i} + \cdots + x_{s_m, t_1, i} \leq 1
     \]
     for each instrument \(i\) and time slot \(t_1\).

   - **Constraint C3 ("The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target")**:
     This constraint can also be specified as binary constraints. For each time slot \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq k\)), we need to ensure that all selected observations at that time slot share the same target. We can introduce additional variables and constraints to track which target is being used in a given time slot, but fundamentally, this constraint can be enforced using binary constraints by ensuring that if multiple requests are scheduled for the same time slot, they must have the same target.

   **Counterexample for C1**: Since Formulation C does not directly enforce Constraint C1, it's impossible to specify \(C1\) as a set of binary constraints. A counterexample would be a scenario where one scientist has three requests and we select only one or two of them without enforcing exactly two selections. For instance, if Scientist 1 submits the following observations:
   - Observation 1: Target T1 with Instrument I1 at Time Slot 1
   - Observation 2: Target T2 with Instrument I2 at Time Slot 1
   - Observation 3: Target T3 with Instrument I3 at Time Slot 1

   If we select only one of these observations (say, the first), then Constraint C1 is not satisfied. Therefore, it's impossible to enforce \(C1\) as a binary constraint in this formulation.

In summary, Formulation C can specify Constraints C2 and C3 using binary constraints but cannot enforce Constraint C1 directly through such formulations.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 1. Use a set of the variables above to describe the rover's state. Do not include extraneous information.
//// ANSWER: To describe the rover's state, we can use the following variables:

- **Current Location (Square on Map)**: The current square where the rover is located.
- **Types of Rocks Already Collected**: A set or list indicating which types of rocks have already been collected. Since there are 10 types of rocks and the rover needs to collect one of each, this could be a binary state for each rock type (e.g., [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]).
- **Current Battery Charge Level**: The current amount of battery charge the rover has.
- **Distance to Lander**: The distance from the current location to the lander's location. This can be calculated based on the map resolution and the coordinates of both locations.
- **Total Weight of Currently Collected Rocks**: The total weight of rocks collected so far, which will contribute to the objective function.

These variables provide a comprehensive description of the rover's state without including unnecessary information:

1. **Current Location (Square on Map)**: This variable helps in determining the cost to traverse and the availability of rocks.
2. **Types of Rocks Already Collected**: Tracks progress towards the goal of collecting one of each type of rock.
3. **Current Battery Charge Level**: Indicates how much charge is available for driving, charging, or picking up rocks.
4. **Distance to Lander**: Helps in planning the return trip and minimizing travel distance.
5. **Total Weight of Currently Collected Rocks**: Contributes to the objective function that needs to be minimized.

These variables collectively capture the essential state information needed to formulate a plan for the rover's exploration, ensuring it meets its objectives efficiently.

Specify the goal test.
//// ANSWER: The goal test for this search problem can be specified as follows:

**Goal Test:**
- The rover has collected one rock sample of each of the 10 types of rocks.
- The rover is at its starting location (the lander) with a full battery charge level.

This means that to achieve the goal, two conditions must be met simultaneously:
1. **Rover's Collection Condition:** All 10 different types of rocks have been collected by the rover. This can be tracked using a variable such as `types_of_rocks_collected` or a similar construct.
2. **Return to Lander Condition:** The rover is back at its starting point (the lander) and has sufficient battery charge, which in this scenario would be 10 units of charge since that's the total capacity.

Formally, if we denote:
- `types_of_rocks_collected` as a set or list indicating the types of rocks collected.
- `current_location` as the square on the map where the rover is located.
- `battery_charge_level` as the current level of battery charge (which should be 10 units to meet the goal).

The goal test can be written as:
\[ \text{Goal} = (\text{types_of_rocks_collected} = \{\text{type}_1, \text{type}_2, ..., \text{type}_{10}\}) \land (current\_location = \text{lander location}) \land (battery\_charge\_level = 10) \]

This ensures that the rover has completed its mission by collecting all required rock samples and returning to the lander with a full battery charge.

Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.
//// ANSWER: ### Actions and Their Effects on State

For the Mars rover problem, we need to specify the possible actions that can be taken by the rover, along with their effects on the state variables. Each action will modify one or more of the given state variables based on its execution.

#### 1. **Drive to a New Location**
   - **Action:** Drive to a new location.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must have sufficient battery charge (at least the amount required for that square).
     - The destination square is within the map boundaries and has not been previously visited.
   - **Effects on State Variables:**
     - `current location` changes to the new location.
     - `time since departure from lander` increases by 1 hour.
     - `time since last charged` remains unchanged if no charging was done, otherwise it is reset to 0.
     - `total distance traveled` increases by the cost of traversing that square (in units of battery charge).
     - If the rover's battery level drops below a certain threshold during travel, it will stop and unfurl solar collectors until fully charged before continuing.

#### 2. **Unfold Solar Collectors to Charge Batteries**
   - **Action:** Unfold solar collectors.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must be stopped (not driving).
     - There is sufficient time available in the current day for charging.
   - **Effects on State Variables:**
     - `time since last charged` remains unchanged if no charging occurs, otherwise it is reset to 0.
     - `current battery charge level` increases by 1 unit per hour of solar collection (up to a maximum of 10 units).
     - `total time spent charging` increases by the number of hours used for charging.

#### 3. **Pick Up Rock**
   - **Action:** Pick up rock.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover is at a location with an uncollected rock type.
     - The rover has sufficient battery charge (1 unit).
     - The rover has not already collected all 10 types of rocks.
   - **Effects on State Variables:**
     - `types of rocks already collected` increases by the new rock type collected.
     - `current location` remains unchanged.
     - `weight of rocks at current location` decreases (if applicable, as only one rock can be picked up).
     - `total weight of currently collected rocks` increases by the weight of the rock just collected.

#### 4. **Return to Lander**
   - **Action:** Return to lander.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The rover must have sufficient battery charge for the return journey (at least the amount required to reach the lander).
     - It is within three days of departure from the lander.
   - **Effects on State Variables:**
     - `current location` changes to the lander's location.
     - `time since departure from lander` increases by 1 hour for each segment of travel back to the lander.
     - `total distance traveled` increases by the cost of traversing the path back to the lander (in units of battery charge).
     - `current day` remains unchanged if the return is completed within three days, otherwise it increments.

### Summary
The actions and their effects on state variables are as follows:

1. **Drive to a New Location:**
   - Precondition: Sufficient battery charge, valid destination.
   - Effects: Update location, increase time since departure, possibly charge batteries if necessary, update distance traveled.

2. **Unfold Solar Collectors to Charge Batteries:**
   - Precondition: Stopped and sufficient time in the current day.
   - Effects: Increase battery charge level up to maximum capacity, update charging time.

3. **Pick Up Rock:**
   - Precondition: Unvisited rock type at current location, sufficient battery charge, not all types collected.
   - Effects: Collect new rock type, decrease weight of rocks if applicable, increase total weight collected.

4. **Return to Lander:**
   - Precondition: Sufficient battery charge and within three days.
   - Effects: Return to lander, update time since departure, distance traveled, possibly increment current day.

These actions fully describe the possible behaviors of the Mars rover in its exploration task while adhering to the constraints provided.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 4. Specify a function that determines the cost of each action. charge : move : pick-up-rock :
//// ANSWER: To specify the cost of each action for the Mars rover, we need to consider both the resource consumption (battery charge) and time required for each action. Here are the functions for determining the cost of each action:

1. **Charge Function:**
   - The function `charge(time)` calculates the battery charge gained from charging.
   - Since one hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge, the function is straightforward:
     \[
     \text{charge}(t) = t
     \]
     where \( t \) is the time (in hours) spent charging.

2. **Move Function:**
   - The function `move(location)` calculates the cost to move from one location to another.
   - Given that the map indicates how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square, we can define the function as follows:
     \[
     \text{move}(location) = (\text{battery\_charge\_cost}, \text{time\_cost})
     \]
     where `battery_charge_cost` is the number of battery units required and `time_cost` is the time in hours needed to reach that location.

3. **Pick-up-Rock Function:**
   - The function `pick_up_rock(location)` calculates the cost associated with picking up a rock.
   - Since picking up a rock requires one unit of battery charge, the function can be defined as:
     \[
     \text{pick\_up\_rock}(location) = (1)
     \]
     where 1 is the battery charge consumed.

These functions are essential for formulating an optimal plan for the rover's exploration. By using these functions, we can evaluate different actions and their associated costs to ensure that the rover collects all required rocks while minimizing both total weight and distance traveled within the given constraints (three days and a maximum of 10 units of battery charge).

To incorporate the tradeoff parameter \( \alpha \) between rock weight and distance, you could adjust the cost function for each action by considering the weight of the collected rocks. For instance, if a rock has a weight \( w \), the effective cost to pick up that rock might be:
\[
\text{pick\_up\_rock}(location) = (1 + \alpha \cdot w)
\]
This adjustment ensures that heavier rocks are more costly in terms of both battery charge and distance.

This can be treated as a path search problem. We would like to find a heuristic. Say whether each of these possible heuristics would be useful in finding the optimal path or, if not, what's wrong with them. Let l be the number of rocks already collected. H1 : The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H2 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H3 : The distance back to the lander
//// ANSWER: For the given problem, let's analyze each heuristic in detail:

### Heuristic Analysis

#### H1: The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 - l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.
- **Usefulness**: This heuristic is useful because it directly considers the distance required to reach the next rock type, which aligns with minimizing the total distance traveled. It helps in prioritizing moves that get the rover closer to obtaining new rock samples.
- **Potential Issues**: While this heuristic can guide the search towards areas where rocks are needed, it does not consider the weight of the rocks or the battery charge level. This might lead to suboptimal solutions if the rover runs out of power before collecting all required types of rocks.

#### H2: The length of the shortest tour through the 10 - l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.
- **Usefulness**: This heuristic is more comprehensive than H1 as it considers a complete path to collect all remaining rock types. It can provide a better estimate of the total distance required, which helps in minimizing the overall travel cost.
- **Potential Issues**: The shortest tour might not always be feasible due to battery constraints or other obstacles on the map. Additionally, this heuristic does not account for the weight of rocks and the current battery level, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions.

#### H3: The distance back to the lander
- **Usefulness**: This heuristic is useful as it ensures that the rover will eventually return to the lander, which is a necessary condition for completing the mission. It helps in planning paths that consider the final destination.
- **Potential Issues**: While this heuristic guarantees that the rover can return home, it does not help in minimizing the total weight of rocks collected or the distance traveled to collect them. This might lead to solutions where the rover spends unnecessary time traveling back and forth between locations.

### Conclusion
None of these heuristics alone would be sufficient to find the optimal path for the Mars rover that minimizes both the total weight of rocks collected and the distance traveled, while ensuring it returns to the lander within three days. However:

- **H1** is useful but might not consider all constraints.
- **H2** provides a more comprehensive approach by considering the shortest tour but still lacks consideration for rock weights and battery levels.
- **H3** ensures the rover can return home but does not help in minimizing the total weight or distance.

To effectively solve this problem, a combined heuristic that considers both H1 and H2 (to minimize travel) and incorporates elements of H3 (to ensure return to base) would be beneficial. Additionally, incorporating weights and battery levels directly into the heuristic could further improve its effectiveness.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G1: A → B A → D B → C B → D B → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why
//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the criteria given, we can analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used.

### G1:
- **Algorithm:** Depth First Search (DFS)
- **Heuristic (if any):** None
- **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:**
  - No. The path found is A → B → C → G with a total cost of 5 + 4 = 9.
  - DFS does not guarantee finding the least-cost path; it explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

### Analysis:
- **G1** follows a depth-first approach, visiting nodes in alphabetical order from their parent. It starts at A and goes to B, then D, and finally visits C and G without considering cost.
- DFS does not prioritize lower-cost paths; it prioritizes exploring deeper branches first, which can lead to suboptimal solutions.

### Summary:
1. **Algorithm:** Depth First Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:**
   - No, because DFS does not consider the cost of paths and explores deeper branches first, leading to a higher total cost path.

This analysis can be repeated for G2-G7 based on their specific node sequences and costs. However, since only G1 is provided in detail here, we will conclude with this example.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm.

If not, why
//// ANSWER: ### Analysis of Search Trees

#### Tree G1:
- **Algorithm:** Depth First Search (DFS)
- **Heuristic (if any):** None
- **Did it find the least-cost path?** No.
  - **Reasoning:** DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. In this case, starting from A, it first visits B and then C, which is not optimal since D has a lower cost (1) compared to B's next node G with a higher cost (6).

#### Tree G2:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first Search
- **Heuristic (if any):** H2
  - Heuristic values: \( h(A)=3 \), \( h(B)=3 \), \( h(C)=0 \), \( h(D)=2 \)
- **Did it find the least-cost path?** No.
  - **Reasoning:** Best-first search uses a heuristic to decide which node to expand next. Here, G2 follows H2, where B and D have lower heuristic values than A, leading to suboptimal choices (D → C with a cost of 4 instead of the optimal path).

### Detailed Analysis for Each Tree:

1. **Tree G1:**
   - **Algorithm:** DFS
   - **Heuristic (if any):** None
   - **Path Traced:** A → B → C → G
   - **Cost Calculation:** \(3 + 6 + 4 = 13\)
   - **Optimality:** No, because the optimal path would be A → D → C with a total cost of 4.

2. **Tree G2:**
   - **Algorithm:** Best-first Search
   - **Heuristic (if any):** H2
   - **Path Traced:** A → B → D → C → G
   - **Cost Calculation:** \(6 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 11\)
   - **Optimality:** No, because the optimal path would be A → D → C with a total cost of 4. The heuristic H2 led to choosing B over D and then C over G.

### Summary:
- Both trees G1 and G2 did not find the least-cost paths due to the nature of their search algorithms and heuristics.
- **G1** is a DFS, which does not guarantee an optimal path in graphs with non-uniform costs.
- **G2** uses Best-first Search with heuristic H2, leading it astray from the optimal path by prioritizing nodes based on lower heuristic values rather than actual costs.

//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the criteria given, let's analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used and whether an optimal path was found.

### G1: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (3) → G
1. **Algorithm**: Depth First Search (DFS)
   - DFS typically explores as far down a branch as it can before backtracking.
   - The sequence shows that nodes are visited in a depth-first manner, with no consideration for cost or heuristic.

2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None

3. **Did it find least-cost path?**: No
   - The optimal path would be A → B → C → G with a total score of 5.
   - However, the actual path found is A → D → G with a total score of 6.

### G2 (Not provided in the question)

### G3: A (7) → B A (6) → D D (8) → C D (6) → G
1. **Algorithm**: Best-First Search (Greedy)
   - The nodes are chosen based on their heuristic values, ignoring cost.
   - The sequence shows that the node with the lowest heuristic value is chosen next.

2. **Heuristic (if any)**: H1
   - Heuristic 1 = { h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3 }

3. **Did it find least-cost path?**: No
   - The optimal path would be A → B → C → G with a total score of 5.
   - However, the actual path found is A → D → G with a total score of 15 (7 + 6 + 2).

### G4 (Not provided in the question)

### G5 (Not provided in the question)

### G6 (Not provided in the question)

### G7 (Not provided in the question)

### Summary for G3:
- **Algorithm**: Best-First Search
- **Heuristic**: H1
- **Did it find least-cost path?**: No. The algorithm chose A → D → C based on heuristic values, leading to a higher total cost of 15 compared to the optimal path's cost of 5.

### Additional Notes:
For G3, if we were to use a different heuristic (H2), the analysis would change as follows:

- **Heuristic**: H2
   - Heuristic 2 = { h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2 }

- The path chosen would be A → B → C → G with a total cost of 5 (optimal).

Thus, the use of different heuristics can significantly impact the search outcome and whether an optimal path is found.

//// ANSWER: Based on the information provided and the structure of the search trees, we can analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used and whether an optimal path was found.

### Tree G4 Analysis

#### 1. Algorithm:
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: The nodes are visited in a way that goes as deep as possible along one branch before backtracking. In this case, the search starts at node A, then moves to B, D, C, and finally G. This pattern of moving deeply into branches before exploring others is characteristic of DFS.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: BFS would explore all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next depth level. The given sequence does not follow this pattern.
- **Uniform Cost Search**: This algorithm explores the least-cost path first, which doesn't match the behavior observed in G4.
- **A* Search and Best-first (Greedy) Search**: Both of these algorithms use heuristics or cost functions to guide their search. The given sequence does not show any heuristic guidance.

Given the pattern, we can conclude that:
**Algorithm: Depth First Search**

#### 2. Heuristic (if any):
- No explicit heuristic is used in this tree. The nodes are visited strictly based on alphabetical order of children and depth-first traversal.

#### 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
- **No**, the algorithm did not find the least-cost path.
- **Reason**: DFS does not guarantee finding the shortest path. In this case, the optimal path (A → B → C → G) has a total cost of 5 + 4 = 9, while the path found by DFS is A → B → D → C → G with a total cost of 3 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 8. However, this is not necessarily optimal as it depends on the actual graph structure and costs which are not provided here.

### Summary for Tree G4:
- **Algorithm**: Depth First Search
- **Heuristic (if any)**: None
- **Optimal Path Found?**: No
- **Reason**: DFS does not guarantee finding the shortest path.

If not, why?
//// ANSWER: ### Analysis of Search Trees

#### Tree G5:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first (greedy) search.
- **Heuristic Used:** H2: heuristic 2 = { h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2 }
- **Did it find the least-cost path?** No.

### Explanation:

1. **Tree G5 Analysis:**
   - The tree starts at node A and expands nodes based on their heuristic values.
   - Node B is expanded first because its heuristic value (3) is higher than D's (2).
   - From B, it expands C (heuristic 0), then D (heuristic 2), and finally G.

2. **Algorithm Identification:**
   - The search tree follows the best-first strategy where nodes are expanded based on their heuristic values.
   - This matches the behavior of a Best-first search algorithm using the specified heuristic H2.

3. **Optimality Check:**
   - To determine if it found the least-cost path, we need to compare the total cost with an optimal solution.
   - The given sequence suggests that G is reached via B and D, but the actual minimum cost path might be different based on link costs not provided in this context.

4. **Why Not Optimal:**
   - Without explicit link costs, it's hard to definitively state why it’s not optimal. However, if we assume typical link costs (e.g., 1 for each edge), the path A → B → C → G might have a lower cost than A → B → D → G.
   - The heuristic values do not necessarily reflect the actual link costs, leading to suboptimal choices.

### Conclusion:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first search with heuristic H2.
- **Heuristic Used:** Yes (H2).
- **Optimality:** No. The path found is not guaranteed to be optimal due to the heuristic's nature and lack of explicit cost information.

//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the criteria given, we can analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used and whether an optimal path was found.

### G1: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G
1. **Algorithm**: Depth First Search (DFS)
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No.
   - DFS does not guarantee finding the shortest path; it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The path found here is A → B → C → G with a total cost of 1 + 5 + 4 = 10, which is not necessarily the least-cost path.

### G2: (Assuming this tree was meant to be G6)
1. **Algorithm**: Depth First Search (DFS)
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No.
   - The same reasoning as above applies; the path A → B → C → G with a total cost of 4 + 6 + 5 = 15 is not necessarily the least-cost path.

### G3: (Assuming this tree was meant to be G7)
1. **Algorithm**: Breadth First Search (BFS)
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - Yes.
   - BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The optimal path would be A → B → D → G with a total cost of 1 + 5 + 2 = 8.

### G4: (Assuming this tree was meant to be G1)
1. **Algorithm**: Depth First Search (DFS)
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No.
   - Same reasoning as above.

### G5: (Assuming this tree was meant to be G6)
1. **Algorithm**: Depth First Search (DFS)
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No.
   - Same reasoning as above.

### G6: A (4) → B B (6) → C B (7) → D B (7) → G A (5) → D D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G
1. **Algorithm**: Depth First Search (DFS)
2. **Heuristic (if any)**: None
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No.
   - Same reasoning as above.

### Summary:
- **G1 and G6**: DFS did not find the optimal path because it does not guarantee finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **G2 (assumed to be G6)**: DFS did not find the optimal path for the same reason.
- **G3 (assumed to be G7)**: BFS found the optimal path, as it guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **G4 and G5**: DFS did not find the optimal path.

This analysis is based on the provided information and assumes that the trees were meant to be labeled as such. If any tree was intended differently, please provide further clarification for a more accurate assessment.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G7: A (1) → B A (3) → D B (6) → C B (5) → D B (7) → G D (6) → C D (8) → G D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
//// ANSWER: Based on the information provided and the structure of the search traces, we can analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used and whether an optimal path was found.

### Tree G1:
- **Algorithm:** Depth First Search (DFS)
- **Heuristic:** None
- **Did it find least-cost path?** No. The path A → B → C → G has a higher total cost compared to the optimal path A → D → G, which has a lower total cost.

### Tree G2:
- **Algorithm:** Breadth First Search (BFS)
- **Heuristic:** None
- **Did it find least-cost path?** Yes. The BFS algorithm will explore nodes level by level and thus would find the shortest path in terms of number of edges, which is also the optimal path for this cost function.

### Tree G3:
- **Algorithm:** Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- **Heuristic:** None
- **Did it find least-cost path?** Yes. UCS will always expand nodes with the lowest path cost first and thus would find the optimal path A → D → G, which has the minimum total cost.

### Tree G4:
- **Algorithm:** A* Search
- **Heuristic (H1):** h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3
- **Did it find least-cost path?** Yes. The A* search with H1 would use the heuristic to guide its exploration and still find the optimal path A → D → G.

### Tree G5:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first (Greedy) Search
- **Heuristic (H2):** h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2
- **Did it find least-cost path?** No. The greedy search with H2 would prioritize nodes based on the heuristic value and may not always find the optimal path. In this case, it might follow a suboptimal path due to the heuristic values.

### Tree G6:
- **Algorithm:** A* Search
- **Heuristic (H1):** h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3
- **Did it find least-cost path?** Yes. The A* search with H1 would still find the optimal path A → D → G.

### Tree G7:
- **Algorithm:** Depth First Search (DFS)
- **Heuristic:** None
- **Did it find least-cost path?** No. Similar to G1, DFS does not guarantee finding the optimal path and in this case, the path chosen is suboptimal compared to A → D → G.
