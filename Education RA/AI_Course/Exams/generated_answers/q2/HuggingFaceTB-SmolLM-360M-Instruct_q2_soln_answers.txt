QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 2, Spring 2005 > 1 Decision Trees > 1. Construct a decision tree for the data.:
//// ANSWER: **Q1. Construct a decision tree for the data:**

In this question, you are asked to construct a decision tree for the data. A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision-making process, where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node represents a class label or predicted value.

To construct a decision tree, you need to:

1. Identify the features or attributes that are relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.
2. Create a binary tree structure, where each node represents a feature or attribute, and each child node represents a split or partition of the data.
3. Choose a splitting criterion, such as the mean or median of the feature, to determine which feature to split on.
4. Create a leaf node, where the predicted class label is assigned.

Here's a step-by-step guide to constructing a decision tree:

1. Identify the features or attributes that are relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.
2. Create a binary tree structure, where each node represents a feature or attribute, and each child node represents a split or partition of the data.
