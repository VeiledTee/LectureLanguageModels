QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 1. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using breadth-first search in this application.
//// ANSWER: Alpha-beta pruning is specifically designed for depth-first search (DFS) to efficiently explore game trees by eliminating branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. The core idea behind alpha-beta pruning is to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the minimax algorithm, which inherently relies on a DFS approach.

1. **Can Alpha-Beta be Generalized to Breadth-First Search?**

   No, alpha-beta pruning cannot be generalized to perform breadth-first search (BFS) while still guaranteeing an optimal answer for game trees. The reason lies in how BFS and alpha-beta pruning fundamentally operate:

   - **Depth-First Search**: DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. This characteristic is crucial for alpha-beta pruning because it allows the algorithm to prune branches early based on previously evaluated nodes, effectively reducing the search space.

   - **Breadth-First Search**: BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This approach does not naturally support the early termination of branches that alpha-beta pruning relies upon because it requires evaluating all sibling nodes at each level before proceeding deeper.

2. **Why Breadth-First Search is Incompatible with Alpha-Beta Pruning:**

   - **Lack of Early Termination**: BFS evaluates all nodes at a given depth before moving deeper, which means it cannot leverage the alpha-beta pruning strategy that depends on evaluating and potentially discarding entire branches based on current bounds (alpha and beta values).

   - **Increased Memory Usage**: BFS requires storing all nodes at the current level in memory, leading to higher space complexity compared to DFS. This can be particularly problematic for large game trees.

3. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Breadth-First Search:**

   While BFS is not compatible with alpha-beta pruning, it has its own set of advantages and disadvantages:

   - **Advantages**:
     - **Guaranteed Optimal Solution**: In a perfect scenario where all nodes are evaluated, BFS will find the optimal solution because it explores all possible moves at each depth level before moving deeper.
     - **Uniform Exploration**: BFS ensures that all nodes at a given depth are explored equally, which can be beneficial in scenarios where depth is not as critical.

   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Inefficiency for Large Trees**: For large game trees, BFS can become impractical due to its high memory requirements and the sheer number of nodes it needs to evaluate.
     - **Lack of Pruning**: Without pruning capabilities like alpha-beta, BFS does not take advantage of any domain-specific knowledge that could reduce the search space.

In conclusion, while breadth-first search is a valid exploration strategy for game trees, it cannot be combined with alpha-beta pruning to maintain efficiency and optimality in the same way depth-first search can. The nature of BFS makes it incompatible with the early termination strategies that are central to alpha-beta pruning's effectiveness.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 2. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application.
//// ANSWER: Yes, alpha-beta pruning can indeed be generalized to perform a progressive deepening exploration of the game tree while still obtaining an optimal answer. Here's how it works and why it is effective:

### How Progressive Deepening Works with Alpha-Beta

1. **Iterative Deepening**: The algorithm performs multiple depth-first searches (DFS), incrementally increasing the depth limit with each iteration. This means that it starts by searching to a shallow depth, then progressively goes deeper until time or other constraints are met.

2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: At each level of depth in these DFS iterations, alpha-beta pruning is applied to eliminate branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. This ensures that only promising moves are explored further, optimizing the search process.

3. **Move Ordering**: Effective move ordering can significantly enhance the efficiency of alpha-beta pruning by increasing the likelihood of early cutoffs. While perfect move ordering is idealistic, practical implementations often achieve performance close to this optimistic scenario.

### Advantages

- **Time Management**: Progressive deepening ensures that a move is always available within any given time constraint, as each iteration provides a valid result from the previous depth.
  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Unlike some other search strategies, iterative deepening does not require additional memory proportional to the depth of the tree since it reuses information from shallower searches.

- **Improved Move Ordering**: As deeper iterations are performed, better move ordering can be achieved based on previously gathered data, which further optimizes alpha-beta pruning efficiency in subsequent searches.

### Disadvantages

- **Overhead**: There is some computational overhead due to repeated exploration of the same nodes at different depths. However, this is often outweighed by the benefits of improved search quality and time management.

In summary, progressive deepening with alpha-beta pruning allows for a more flexible and efficient approach to game tree exploration, maintaining optimality while providing practical advantages in terms of time and resource management.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: In this path search problem with a very large branching factor but short sequences of actions (whose exact length is unknown), and where all actions have the same cost, the optimal search algorithm to use is **breadth-first search (BFS)**. 

### Why Breadth-First Search?

1. **Uniform Cost**: Since all actions have the same cost, BFS will naturally explore paths level by level, ensuring that it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of actions.

2. **Short Sequences**: Given that solutions involve short sequences of actions, BFS is efficient because it explores all nodes at a given depth before moving to the next level. This ensures that once a solution is found, it is optimal.

3. **Large Branching Factor**: Although BFS can be memory-intensive due to its need to store all nodes at the current frontier, the problem's nature (short sequences) mitigates this issue because the number of levels to explore remains small.

### Conditions for Using Visited or Expanded Lists

- **Visited List**: A visited list is beneficial in any search algorithm to avoid revisiting nodes that have already been explored. This can prevent cycles and redundant work, which is particularly useful when the graph has loops or repeated states.

- **Expanded List**: An expanded list keeps track of all nodes that have been processed. It's useful for ensuring that once a node is expanded, it doesn't get re-expanded unnecessarily, which can save computational resources.

In summary, BFS is ideal for this problem due to its ability to find the shortest path in terms of action sequences when costs are uniform. Using visited and expanded lists helps optimize the search by preventing redundant exploration of nodes.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: In the scenario described, where you have a path search problem with a very large branching factor but relatively short sequences of actions with widely varying costs, the A* algorithm is an appropriate choice for finding the optimal solution. Here's why:

### Why Use A*?

1. **Heuristic Guidance**: A* uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal. This helps prioritize paths that are more likely to lead to an optimal solution, effectively reducing the search space.

2. **Cost Consideration**: Since actions have widely varying costs, A* is advantageous because it considers both the actual cost incurred so far (g(n)) and the estimated cost to reach the goal (h(n)), ensuring that the path chosen is not just promising but also cost-effective.

3. **Optimality**: When using an admissible heuristic (one that never overestimates the true cost), A* guarantees finding the least-cost path to the goal, which is crucial when costs vary significantly.

### Conditions for Using Visited or Expanded Lists

- **Visited List**: This list keeps track of nodes that have already been expanded. It's particularly useful in large search spaces to avoid redundant work and ensure each node is processed only once. However, it can consume significant memory if the branching factor is very high.

- **Expanded List**: Similar to the visited list, but specifically for nodes that have been fully explored. This can help prevent revisiting nodes unnecessarily.

### When to Use These Lists

1. **Memory Availability**: If you have sufficient memory resources, using a visited or expanded list can significantly improve efficiency by preventing redundant expansions and ensuring each node is processed only once.

2. **Repetitive States**: In problems where states might be repeated due to the large branching factor, these lists help avoid cycles and unnecessary computations.

3. **Performance Considerations**: If performance is critical and you notice that the algorithm is revisiting nodes frequently, implementing a visited or expanded list can reduce computation time.

### Conclusion

A* is well-suited for this problem due to its ability to handle varying costs effectively while ensuring optimality with an admissible heuristic. The use of visited or expanded lists depends on memory constraints and the nature of the search space, particularly if there are repetitive states that could lead to inefficiencies without such tracking mechanisms.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques, let's first understand the setup and constraints:

- **Variables**: The squares on a 3x3 board sectioned into five parts: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- **Domains**: Each square can be colored either Red (R) or Black (B).
- **Constraints**: Adjacent squares vertically or horizontally must not have the same color.

Initially, all variables (squares) have domains { R, B }. The goal is to determine what happens when we apply full constraint propagation on this initial state.

### Constraint Propagation Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Domains: 
     - V1 (square 1): { R, B }
     - V2 (square 2): { R, B }
     - V3 (square 3): { R, B }
     - V4 (square 4): { R, B }
     - V5 (square 5): { R, B }

2. **Apply Constraints**:
   - Constraint between V1 and V2: They cannot have the same color.
   - Constraint between V1 and V4: They cannot have the same color.
   - Constraint between V2 and V3: They cannot have the same color.
   - Constraint between V2 and V5: They cannot have the same color.
   - Constraint between V3 and V5: They cannot have the same color.
   - Constraint between V4 and V5: They cannot have the same color.

3. **Propagation**:
   - Start with any variable, say V1. Assign a value (e.g., R) to V1.
   - Propagate this assignment to its neighbors:
     - V2 and V4 must be B because they are adjacent to V1 (R).
   - Now propagate from V2 and V4:
     - V3, being adjacent to V2 (B), can only be R.
     - V5, being adjacent to both V2 (B) and V4 (B), can only be R.

### Resulting Domains After Full Propagation:

- **V1**: { R } or { B } (depends on initial assignment)
- **V2**: If V1 is R, then V2 = { B }; if V1 is B, then V2 = { R }
- **V3**: Opposite of V2
- **V4**: Opposite of V1
- **V5**: Same as V3

### Conclusion:

After full constraint propagation, the domains are reduced based on initial assignments. Each variable's domain will be a single value determined by its constraints with adjacent variables. The exact values depend on the initial assignment to one of the variables (e.g., V1), but the structure ensures that no two adjacent squares share the same color.

Thus, full constraint propagation effectively reduces the problem to determining an initial assignment and then propagating those constraints throughout the board.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem using constraint satisfaction principles and backtracking search combined with constraint propagation, let's analyze how the constraints affect the domains of each variable on a 3x3 checkerboard section.

**Initial Setup:**
- Variables: \( V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4, V_5 \) corresponding to squares 1 through 5.
- Domains: Initially, all variables have the domain {R, B} except for \( V_5 \), which is restricted to {B}.

**Constraints:**
- Adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) must not share the same color.

**Propagation Process:**

1. **Start with \( V_5 = B \):**
   - Since \( V_5 \) is fixed at B, its adjacent variables \( V_2 \) and \( V_4 \) cannot be B.
   - Update domains:
     - Domain of \( V_2 \) becomes {R}
     - Domain of \( V_4 \) becomes {R}

2. **Propagate from \( V_2 = R \):**
   - \( V_1 \) and \( V_3 \), which are adjacent to \( V_2 \), cannot be R.
   - Update domains:
     - Domain of \( V_1 \) becomes {B}
     - Domain of \( V_3 \) becomes {B}

3. **Check consistency for \( V_4 = R \):**
   - \( V_5 \) is already B, so no further changes are needed here.

**Resulting Domains:**

- \( V_1 \): {B}
- \( V_2 \): {R}
- \( V_3 \): {B}
- \( V_4 \): {R}
- \( V_5 \): {B}

These domains reflect the constraints imposed by the initial assignment and subsequent propagation, ensuring no two adjacent squares share the same color.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables?
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem using a combination of backtracking with forward checking in a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) context, let's analyze how assigning a color to one variable affects the domains of adjacent variables.

### Initial Setup:
- **Variables**: Squares 1 through 5 on a 3x3 board.
- **Domains**: Each square can be colored either Red (R) or Black (B).
- **Constraints**: Adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) cannot have the same color.

### Assignment and Forward Checking:

1. **Assign Variable 1 to R**:
   - Square 1 is assigned the color Red (R).

2. **Apply Forward Checking**:
   - Forward checking involves looking at constraints involving the variable that was just assigned and updating the domains of its neighbors accordingly.
   - For square 1, which is adjacent to squares 2 and 4, we need to ensure these do not also become R.

3. **Update Domains**:
   - **Square 2**: Adjacent to Square 1 (R). Therefore, Square 2 cannot be R. Its domain becomes { B }.
   - **Square 4**: Similarly, adjacent to Square 1 (R), so its domain becomes { B }.

4. **Remaining Squares**:
   - **Square 3**: Not directly adjacent to Square 1, so no change in its domain. It remains { R, B }.
   - **Square 5**: Also not directly adjacent to Square 1, so its domain remains unchanged as { R, B }.

### Resulting Domains:

- **Variable 1**: Assigned R (no domain since it's assigned).
- **Variable 2**: Domain is { B }.
- **Variable 3**: Domain is { R, B }.
- **Variable 4**: Domain is { B }.
- **Variable 5**: Domain is { R, B }.

This forward checking step reduces the domains of variables that are directly constrained by the assignment to Variable 1. The remaining variables retain their full domain unless further assignments and checks are made.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color.

We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored. RB RBRB RBRBRBRB RBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem, we need to simulate the pure backtracking (BT) search process for assigning colors to a 3x3 checkerboard section with constraints. The goal is to ensure adjacent squares do not share the same color using only two colors: red (R) and black (B). We have five variables representing the squares, numbered 1 through 5, and we are given that variable 5 has a domain of { B }.

### Steps for Pure Backtracking:

1. **Variable Order**: Examine variables in numerical order starting with 1.
2. **Color Assignment Order**: Attempt to assign R first, then B if necessary.
3. **Constraints**: Adjacent squares (vertically or horizontally) cannot have the same color.

### Tree Representation and Exploration:

The tree represents all possible assignments of colors to the five variables. We will mark nodes that are explored during pure backtracking and cross out those where a constraint test fails.

#### Initial Assignments:
- Start with variable 1: Try R, then B if needed.
  
#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Variable 1**:
   - Assign R (R _ _ _): This is valid as there are no constraints yet.
   - Assign B (B _ _ _): Also valid initially.

2. **Variable 2**:
   - For assignment R from variable 1:
     - Try R (RR _ _): Fails because 1 and 2 are adjacent.
     - Try B (RB _ _): Valid.
   - For assignment B from variable 1:
     - Try R (BR _ _): Valid.
     - Try B (BB _ _): Fails because 1 and 2 are adjacent.

3. **Variable 3**:
   - For assignment RB from variables 1 and 2:
     - Try R (RBR _): Valid.
     - Try B (RBB _): Fails because 2 and 3 are adjacent.
   - For assignment BR from variables 1 and 2:
     - Try R (BRR _): Fails because 2 and 3 are adjacent.
     - Try B (BRB _): Valid.

4. **Variable 4**:
   - For assignment RBR from variables 1, 2, and 3:
     - Try R (RBR_R): Fails because 3 and 4 are adjacent.
     - Try B (RBRB): Valid.
   - For assignment BRB from variables 1, 2, and 3:
     - Try R (BRBR): Valid.
     - Try B (BRBB): Fails because 3 and 4 are adjacent.

5. **Variable 5**:
   - Domain is fixed as { B }, so we assign B to variable 5 in all cases.
   - For assignment RBRB from variables 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - Check (RBRBB): Valid because 4 and 5 are adjacent with different colors.
   - For assignment BRBR from variables 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - Check (BRBRB): Fails because 4 and 5 are adjacent with the same color.

### Marked Tree:

- **R _ _ _**: Attempted
  - **RB _ _**: Attempted
    - **RBR_**: Attempted
      - **RBRB**: Attempted, Valid (Check)
    - **RBB_**: Crossed out (Fails at step 3)
  - **RR_**: Crossed out (Fails at step 2)

- **B _ _ _**: Attempted
  - **BR_**: Attempted
    - **BRR_**: Crossed out (Fails at step 3)
    - **BRB_**: Attempted
      - **BRBR**: Attempted, Valid until variable 5
      - **BRBB**: Crossed out (Fails at step 4)
  - **BB_**: Crossed out (Fails at step 2)

### Conclusion:

The valid assignment found using pure backtracking is RBRBB. This satisfies all constraints for the given problem setup.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 6. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) but with dynamic variable ordering, using the most-constrained-variable strategy, give a list of all the variable assignments attempted, in sequence. If there is a tie between variables, use the lowest-numbered one first. Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None     | 5 = B    | 2= R   | 1= B   | 3= B   | 4= R   | |---------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R, B } | { R }    |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  | { B }  |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R, B } | { R }    | { R }  | { R }  | { R }  |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }    |          |        |        |        |        | { }
//// ANSWER: To solve the given CSP problem using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) and dynamic variable ordering, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Domains for each variable initially: {R, B}.
   - Constraints: Adjacent squares cannot have the same color.

2. **Dynamic Variable Ordering**:
   - Use the most-constrained-variable (MCV) strategy to select variables dynamically. This means choosing the variable with the fewest legal values in its domain at any step.
   - If there's a tie, choose the lowest-numbered variable.

3. **Backtracking with Forward Checking**:
   - Assign a value to a variable and use forward checking to update domains of unassigned variables that are affected by this assignment.
   - If a domain becomes empty due to an assignment, backtrack.

Let's go through the sequence:

1. **Initial Assignment**: 
   - No assignments yet, all domains are {R, B}.

2. **Choose Variable 5**:
   - All variables have equal constraints initially, but we choose the lowest-numbered variable in case of a tie.
   - Assign 5 = B (arbitrarily choosing B for demonstration).
   - Update domains using forward checking:
     - Domain of 1: {R} (since 1 is adjacent to 5)
     - Domain of 4: {R} (since 4 is adjacent to 5)

3. **Choose Variable 2**:
   - Most constrained variable now is 2 with domain {R, B}.
   - Assign 2 = R.
   - Update domains using forward checking:
     - Domain of 1: {B} (since 1 is adjacent to 2)
     - Domain of 3: {B} (since 3 is adjacent to 2)

4. **Choose Variable 1**:
   - Most constrained variable now is 1 with domain {B}.
   - Assign 1 = B.
   - Update domains using forward checking:
     - Domain of 3: remains {B} (no change since 3 was already {B})
     - Domain of 4: remains {R} (no change)

5. **Choose Variable 3**:
   - Most constrained variable now is 3 with domain {B}.
   - Assign 3 = B.
   - Update domains using forward checking:
     - Domain of 2: no change (already assigned)
     - Domain of 4: remains {R} (no change)

6. **Choose Variable 4**:
   - Most constrained variable now is 4 with domain {R}.
   - Assign 4 = R.

The sequence of assignments attempted in order is:

1. None
2. 5 = B
3. 2 = R
4. 1 = B
5. 3 = B
6. 4 = R

This sequence respects the constraints and uses dynamic variable ordering with forward checking to efficiently reduce domains during the search process.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation A, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots, let's analyze each part of the question:

1. **Domain**: 
   - The domain for each variable (instrument/time slot) consists of all possible observations that can be scheduled in that particular time slot and with a specific instrument. Since there are three instruments and each instrument can target different objects at any given time slot, the domain includes all combinations of targets and scientists' requests that involve using that specific instrument during that time slot.

2. **Size of the Domain**:
   - The size of the domain for each variable is determined by the number of possible observations that can be scheduled in a single instrument/time slot. Since there are \(m\) scientists, each with \(n\) requests, and each request involves one target, one instrument, and one time slot, the maximum number of potential observations per instrument/time slot is \(mn\). However, not all these requests will necessarily involve the specific instrument or time slot in question.

3. **Necessarily Satisfied Constraints**:
   - Constraint C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot) is inherently satisfied by this formulation because each variable represents a unique combination of an instrument and a time slot. Thus, only one observation can be assigned to any given variable.
   - Constraint C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is also naturally enforced within each time slot across all instruments since we are considering each instrument/time slot as a separate variable.

4. **Binary Constraints**:
   - The constraints cannot be fully specified as binary in this formulation because they involve multiple variables simultaneously. For example, Constraint C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) requires coordination across potentially all \(n\) requests for each of the \(m\) scientists, which involves more than just pairs of variables.
   - Similarly, ensuring that all scheduled observations in a single time slot have the same target (Constraint C3) involves checking consistency across all three instruments within that time slot, which again involves multiple variables.

In summary, while some constraints are naturally satisfied due to the formulation, others require multi-variable considerations and thus cannot be reduced to binary constraints.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation A, where the variables represent the \(3k\) instrument/time slots, let's analyze each part of the question:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables:**
   - Each variable corresponds to an observation scheduled at a specific instrument and time slot.
   - The value domain consists of possible observations that can be assigned to each instrument/time slot.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\)):**
   - There are three instruments, and \(k\) time slots, resulting in a total of \(3k\) variables.
   - Each variable can potentially be assigned any one of the \(mn\) observations submitted by all scientists.
   - Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable is \(mn\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation:**
   - **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):** This constraint is inherently satisfied because each variable represents a unique instrument/time slot combination.
   - **C3 (Observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** This constraint can be enforced by ensuring that within any given time slot, all three instruments are assigned observations with the same target.

4. **Whether the Constraints Can Be Specified as Binary Constraints:**
   - **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made):** This is not a binary constraint in this formulation because it involves ensuring that exactly two out of \(n\) observations for each scientist are selected, which requires considering all \(n\) variables related to a single scientist.
   - **C2 and C3:** These can be expressed as binary constraints:
     - For **C2**, between any two variables representing the same instrument at different time slots, or different instruments at the same time slot, we ensure that they do not both have observations scheduled.
     - For **C3**, for any pair of variables within the same time slot (but possibly different instruments), we enforce that if one is assigned an observation with a particular target, the other must be assigned an observation with the same target.

In summary, Formulation A allows constraints C2 and C3 to be expressed as binary constraints, but not C1. The domain size for each variable in this formulation is \(mn\), reflecting all possible observations that could be scheduled in any given instrument/time slot.

//// ANSWER: In Formulation A, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots, let's analyze the problem step by step:

### 1. Value Domain for Variables
- **Variables**: Each variable corresponds to an instrument/time slot.
- **Value Domain**: The value domain for each variable is the set of all possible observations that can be scheduled in that specific instrument/time slot.

### 2. Size of the Domain for Variables
- Since there are \(k\) time slots and 3 instruments, there are \(3k\) variables.
- Each variable (instrument/time slot) can potentially have any observation from the combined list of all scientists' requests as its value.
- **Size of the Domain**: The size of the domain for each variable is \(mn\), where \(m\) is the number of scientists and \(n\) is the number of observations per scientist.

### 3. Satisfied Constraints
- **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot)**: This constraint is inherently satisfied because each variable corresponds to a unique instrument/time slot, ensuring that only one observation can be assigned to any given instrument/time slot.
  
- **C3 (Observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target)**: This constraint is also inherently satisfied. Since each time slot has three variables (one for each instrument), and they are all part of the same time slot, ensuring that they share the same observation (and thus the same target) satisfies this constraint.

### 4. Binary Constraints Specification
- **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made)**: This constraint cannot be directly expressed as a binary constraint in Formulation A because it involves considering all \(n\) observations for each of the \(m\) scientists, which requires global knowledge about the assignments across multiple variables.

  - **Counterexample**: Consider a scenario with two scientists and each has submitted three requests. In this formulation, ensuring that exactly two out of these three requests are scheduled cannot be reduced to checking pairs of instrument/time slots because it involves considering all observations for each scientist collectively.

In summary, in Formulation A:
- Constraints C2 and C3 are inherently satisfied due to the structure of the variables.
- Constraint C1 cannot be expressed as binary constraints within this formulation.

//// ANSWER: In Formulation A, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots, let's analyze each part of the question:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables:**
   - Each variable represents an instrument/time slot combination.
   - The value domain consists of either a specific observation or no observation being scheduled in that slot.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables:**
   - For each instrument/time slot, there are \(mn\) possible observations (since there are \(m\) scientists and each has submitted \(n\) observations).
   - Additionally, there is the option of not scheduling any observation.
   - Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable is \(mn + 1\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied:**
   - Constraint C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot) is inherently satisfied because each instrument/time slot can only be assigned one observation or none.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification:**
   - The constraints cannot all be specified as binary in this formulation.
   - **Counterexample for Binary Constraints:**
     - Constraint C1 requires exactly two observations from each scientist's list to be scheduled. This involves considering all \(n\) requests of a single scientist, which is inherently more than binary (involving multiple variables).
     - Constraint C3 requires that all observations in a single time slot have the same target. This involves checking consistency across three instruments for each time slot, again involving multiple variables.

In summary, while some constraints can be expressed as binary between pairs of instrument/time slots (like ensuring no two instruments are scheduled with different targets at the same time), others inherently require considering multiple variables simultaneously, thus cannot be fully captured by binary constraints in this formulation.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation B, where the variables are the \(m\) scientists:

1. **Domain**: 
   - Each scientist needs to have exactly two observations scheduled from their list of \(n\) requested observations. Therefore, the domain for each scientist is all possible pairs of observations they can choose from their list.

2. **Size of the Domain**:
   - The size of the domain for each scientist's variable is given by the number of ways to choose 2 observations out of \(n\). This is calculated using combinations: \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Necessarily Satisfied Constraints**:
   - Constraint C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) is inherently satisfied by this formulation because the domain for each scientist variable consists of pairs of observations.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification**:
   - The constraints cannot all be specified as binary in this formulation. Here’s why:

     - **Constraint C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot)** and **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target)** involve interactions between multiple scientists' choices, not just pairs of them. For example, ensuring that no two scientists schedule an observation using the same instrument in the same time slot requires considering all scientists who might choose that particular combination.

     - **Counterexample**: Suppose there are three scientists (A, B, C) and each has requested observations involving different instruments at the same time slot. If scientist A chooses one pair of observations and scientist B chooses another pair that conflicts with A's choice in terms of instrument or target, this conflict involves more than just a binary relationship between any two scientists.

In summary, while Constraint C1 is naturally satisfied by Formulation B, Constraints C2 and C3 require considering interactions among multiple scientists' choices, making them non-binary in nature.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation B, where the variables are the \(m\) scientists, let's analyze each part:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables**:
   - Each scientist needs to have exactly two observations scheduled from their list of \(n\) requested observations.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\))**:
   - The domain size for each scientist is determined by the number of ways to choose 2 observations out of \(n\). This can be calculated using combinations: \(\binom{n}{2}\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation**:

4. **Whether the Constraints Can Be Specified as Binary Constraints in This Formulation**:
   - In this formulation, constraints C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot) and C3 (observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) cannot be directly expressed as binary constraints between scientists because they involve interactions between different observations across multiple scientists.
   - **Counterexample**: Consider two scientists, \(S_1\) and \(S_2\), each with their own set of requested observations. Constraint C2 requires that no two observations scheduled in the same time slot use the same instrument. However, this involves checking all possible pairs of observations from both scientists' chosen sets against each other, which cannot be reduced to a simple binary relationship between just \(S_1\) and \(S_2\).

In summary, while Constraint C1 is naturally satisfied by this formulation, Constraints C2 and C3 require more complex interactions that involve multiple variables beyond pairwise relationships, making them unsuitable for direct representation as binary constraints in this setup.

     - **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** Similarly, this constraint can be checked between any two scientists by ensuring that if they both choose an observation in the same time slot, those observations must target the same object.

In summary, Formulation B allows constraints C1 to be inherently satisfied and enables constraints C2 and C3 to be expressed as binary constraints between pairs of scientists.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation B, where the variables are the \(m\) scientists, let's analyze each aspect of the problem:

1. **Value Domain for the Variables**: 
   - Each scientist needs to have exactly two observations scheduled from their list of \(n\) requested observations.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables**:
   - For each scientist, we need to choose 2 out of \(n\) observations. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\). Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable (scientist) is \(\binom{n}{2}\).

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied**:
   - Constraint C1 is inherently satisfied because the formulation directly involves choosing exactly two observations per scientist.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification**:
   - In this formulation, constraints C2 and C3 cannot be expressed as binary constraints. Here's why:

     - **Constraint C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
       - This constraint involves interactions between multiple scientists' chosen observations because they may overlap in terms of the instrument and time slot used. Since each scientist can choose two observations, ensuring that no more than one observation uses a particular instrument at a given time requires considering combinations of choices across different scientists. Thus, this cannot be reduced to binary constraints.

     - **Constraint C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
       - Similar to C2, this constraint involves ensuring that all chosen observations in a specific time slot share the same target. This requires considering the choices of potentially multiple scientists simultaneously, as their selected observations might overlap in time slots.

   **Counterexample**:
   - Suppose Scientist 1 chooses Observation A (Instrument X, Time Slot 1) and Scientist 2 chooses Observation B (Instrument Y, Time Slot 1). Both observations are scheduled at Time Slot 1 but have different targets. To enforce C3, we need to consider both scientists' choices together, which cannot be captured by a binary constraint between just two variables.

In summary, while Constraint C1 is naturally satisfied in this formulation, Constraints C2 and C3 require considering multiple scientists simultaneously and thus cannot be expressed as binary constraints within this framework.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C, where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests:

1. **Domain**: 
   - Each variable represents a specific request from a scientist's list of observations.
   - The domain for each variable is binary: {0, 1}, where 0 means the observation is not scheduled and 1 means it is scheduled.

2. **Size of the Domain**:
   - Since each variable can take on one of two values (0 or 1), the size of the domain for each variable is 2.
   - There are \(mn\) such variables, corresponding to all the requests from all scientists.

3. **Constraints Necessarily Satisfied by Formulation**:
   - **C1**: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
     - This constraint can be naturally enforced in this formulation by ensuring that for each scientist (considering their \(n\) requests), exactly two of the corresponding variables are set to 1.
   - **C2 and C3** cannot be inherently satisfied just by choosing this formulation. They require additional constraints to ensure consistency across instrument/time slots and targets.

4. **Binary Constraints Specification**:
   - **C1**: This constraint can be expressed as a binary constraint between pairs of requests from the same scientist's list. For each scientist, you need to ensure that exactly two out of their \(n\) requests are scheduled.
     - Example: For a scientist with requests \(R_{i1}, R_{i2}, \ldots, R_{in}\), you can create constraints such as \(R_{ij} + R_{ik} \leq 1\) for all pairs \((j, k)\) where \(j \neq k\), and ensure that the sum of any two chosen requests equals 2.
   - **C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
     - This constraint can be expressed as a binary constraint between any pair of requests that involve the same instrument and time slot. If two requests \(R_a\) and \(R_b\) both require the same instrument at the same time, then \(R_a + R_b \leq 1\).
   - **C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
     - This constraint is more complex to express as binary constraints because it involves ensuring consistency across potentially multiple requests. A counterexample would be if two different scientists request different targets at the same time slot; this cannot be directly enforced with simple pairwise constraints without additional logic.

In summary, while C1 can be naturally expressed using binary constraints in this formulation, C2 and C3 require more complex handling to ensure consistency across multiple variables.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: In Formulation C, where the variables represent the individual observations requested by each scientist, we need to determine the size of the domain for these variables.

1. **Variables**: Each variable corresponds to a specific observation request made by a scientist. There are \( m \) scientists and each has submitted \( n \) requests, resulting in a total of \( mn \) variables.

2. **Value Domain**: The value domain for each variable (observation request) is binary: either the observation is scheduled (1) or it is not scheduled (0).

3. **Size of Domain**: Since each variable can take on one of two values (scheduled or not scheduled), the size of the domain for each individual variable is 2.

4. **Overall Domain Size**: The overall domain size, considering all \( mn \) variables together, would be \( 2^{mn} \). This represents all possible combinations of scheduling or not scheduling each of the \( mn \) requests.

In summary, for Formulation C, where the variables are the scientists' requests:

- **Size of Domain for Each Variable**: 2 (scheduled or not scheduled)
- **Overall Domain Size**: \( 2^{mn} \)

This reflects all possible ways to choose which observations from the \( mn \) requests can be included in the schedule.

//// ANSWER: In Formulation C, where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests, let's analyze which constraints are necessarily satisfied due to this formulation:

1. **Value Domain for Variables:**
   - Each variable corresponds to a specific request made by a scientist. The value domain is binary: either the observation is scheduled (value 1) or it is not (value 0).

2. **Size of the Domain for Variables:**
   - Since each variable can take on one of two values (scheduled or not), the size of the domain for each variable is 2.

3. **Satisfied Constraints:**

   - **Constraint C1:** Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
     - This constraint is inherently satisfied in this formulation because each scientist has \(n\) requests, and we are selecting exactly two to schedule (value 1). The remaining \(n-2\) requests will not be scheduled (value 0).

   - **Constraint C3:** The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
     - This constraint is naturally enforced because each request corresponds to a unique target. If multiple requests are scheduled in the same time slot, they must all refer to the same target due to the uniqueness of targets per scientist.

4. **Binary Constraints:**

   - **Constraint C2:** At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
     - This constraint cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint in this formulation. The reason is that each variable represents an individual request, and checking if two requests conflict (i.e., use the same instrument at the same time) involves more than just comparing pairs of variables. It requires considering all requests for a given instrument and time slot simultaneously.

   - **Counterexample for Binary Constraint Specification:**
     - Suppose we have two scientists with overlapping requests involving the same instrument and time slot. In this formulation, each request is a separate variable, so ensuring that only one such request per instrument per time slot is scheduled requires checking all relevant variables together, not just pairs.

In summary, in Formulation C, constraints C1 and C3 are inherently satisfied due to the nature of the formulation. However, constraint C2 cannot be expressed as binary constraints because it involves considering multiple requests simultaneously for a given instrument and time slot.

//// ANSWER: In Formulation C, where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests, let's analyze whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints:

1. **Value Domain for Variables:**
   - Each variable represents a specific request from a scientist. The value domain is whether the request is scheduled (selected) or not.

2. **Size of the Domain:**
   - For each request, there are 2 possible values: either it is included in the schedule or it is not. Thus, the size of the domain for each variable is 2.

3. **Necessarily Satisfied Constraints:**
   - Constraint C1 (exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) can be naturally enforced by ensuring that exactly two requests per scientist are selected.
   - Constraint C3 (observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is inherently satisfied because each request specifies its own target, and only one observation per instrument per time slot is allowed.

4. **Binary Constraints:**
   - **Constraint C1:** This constraint involves ensuring that exactly two requests are selected for each scientist. Since this involves all \(n\) requests of a single scientist, it cannot be expressed as a binary constraint (which involves only pairs of variables). Instead, it requires a global condition on the set of requests from each scientist.
   
   - **Constraint C2:** This constraint states that at most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. To express this as binary constraints:
     - For any two requests \(R_i\) and \(R_j\) that share the same instrument and time slot, we need a constraint ensuring that not both can be selected simultaneously. This can be expressed as a binary constraint: if \(R_i\) is selected, then \(R_j\) cannot be, and vice versa.
     - However, this does not cover all combinations of requests sharing an instrument and time slot unless explicitly stated for every pair, which becomes complex when more than two requests share the same instrument and time slot.

   - **Constraint C3:** This constraint is inherently satisfied by the formulation since each request specifies its own target. The binary nature comes into play only if we consider pairs of requests that could potentially conflict in terms of targets within a single time slot, but this is naturally avoided by ensuring no two conflicting requests are both selected.

In summary, while some constraints can be expressed as binary constraints (like C2 for specific pairs), others like C1 cannot due to their global nature over multiple variables.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 1. Use a set of the variables above to describe the rover's state. Do not include extraneous information.
//// ANSWER: To formulate the search problem for the Mars rover, we need to define its state using relevant variables that capture all necessary aspects of its environment and objectives. The goal is to collect one of each type of 10 rocks within three days while minimizing a combination of total weight and distance traveled.

Here's how you can describe the rover's state:

1. **Types of Rocks Already Collected**: This variable keeps track of which types of rocks have been collected so far. It helps determine when all required rock types are gathered, marking the completion of one part of the objective.

2. **Current Rover Location (Square on Map)**: The current position of the rover is crucial for planning movements and determining proximity to potential rock collection sites or the lander.

3. **Current Battery Charge Level**: Knowing how much charge remains in the battery is essential for decision-making, especially when considering whether to move, collect a rock, or recharge using solar collectors.

4. **Total Weight of Currently Collected Rocks**: This variable helps monitor the total weight constraint and is necessary for calculating the tradeoff with distance traveled.

5. **Current Day**: Since the mission must be completed within three days, tracking the current day ensures that time constraints are respected.

These variables collectively describe the rover's state by capturing its progress towards collecting all required rock types, managing resources like battery charge, and adhering to the time constraint of three days. Other variables such as "current lander location" or "time since last charged" might be useful in more detailed planning but are not strictly necessary for describing the basic state needed for this search problem formulation.

By focusing on these key variables, you can effectively model the rover's decision-making process and plan its exploration strategy to meet the mission objectives.

Specify the goal test.
//// ANSWER: To specify the goal test for the Mars rover exploration problem, we need to determine when the rover has successfully completed its mission according to the objectives provided. The objective is to collect one of each of 10 types of rocks within three days while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled.

Here's how you can formulate the goal test:

1. **Types of Rocks Collected**: The rover must have collected at least one sample of each of the 10 specified types of rocks. This means that the set of rock types already collected by the rover should match exactly with the set of all required rock types.

2. **Time Constraint**: The mission must be completed within three days. Therefore, the current day variable should not exceed three.

3. **Return to Lander**: After collecting all necessary samples, the rover must return to its starting location at the lander. This means that the current rover location should match the current lander location.

4. **Battery Charge**: The rover must have enough battery charge to return to the lander after collecting the last rock sample. This ensures that the rover does not run out of power before completing its mission.

Given these conditions, the goal test can be specified as follows:

- Check if all 10 types of rocks have been collected.
- Ensure that the current day is less than or equal to three.
- Verify that the rover's current location matches the lander's location.
- Confirm that the battery charge level is sufficient for returning to the lander.

If all these conditions are met, then the goal state has been reached.

Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.
//// ANSWER: To specify the actions for the Mars rover's exploration problem, we need to define each action, describe its effects on the state of the world, and outline any necessary preconditions. Here are the possible actions:

1. **Drive**
   - **Description**: Move from one square to an adjacent square on the map.
   - **State Modifications**:
     - Update current rover location to the new square.
     - Decrease battery charge by the units required for that move (as indicated by the map).
     - Increase time since last charged and time since departure from lander.
     - Increase distance traveled.
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The destination square must be reachable with current battery charge.
     - There should be enough battery to cover both the drive and any subsequent actions in that location.

2. **Collect Rock**
   - **Description**: Pick up a rock from the current location if it is of an uncollected type.
   - **State Modifications**:
     - Add the rock type to the list of types collected.
     - Increase total weight of currently collected rocks by the expected weight at that location.
     - Decrease battery charge by one unit (required for picking up a rock).
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The current location must contain an uncollected type of rock.
     - There should be enough battery to perform this action.

3. **Charge**
   - **Description**: Stop and unfurl solar collectors to recharge the batteries.
   - **State Modifications**:
     - Increase battery charge by one unit for each hour spent charging, up to a maximum of 10 units (total capacity).
     - Reset time since last charged to zero.
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The rover must be stationary and not in the process of collecting a rock or driving.

4. **Return to Lander**
   - **Description**: Navigate back to the lander's location.
   - **State Modifications**:
     - Update current rover location to match the lander's location.
     - Decrease battery charge based on the path taken (as indicated by the map).
     - Increase distance traveled.
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The destination (lander) must be reachable with the remaining battery charge.

These actions are designed to allow the rover to navigate, collect rocks, manage its energy resources, and ensure it returns safely to the lander within the constraints of time and battery capacity. Each action modifies specific state variables related to location, battery level, collected rock types, and total weight, while ensuring that preconditions such as sufficient battery charge are met before execution.

This will help in formulating a plan that minimizes the combination of total weight collected and distance traveled while ensuring the rover returns to the lander within three days.

### Cost Function Components

1. **Charge**: 
   - **Cost**: 0 (since it doesn't consume battery charge but rather replenishes it)
   - **Time**: 1 hour per unit of charge gained
   - **Battery Impact**: Increases current battery level by up to 10 units, depending on how much time is spent charging.

2. **Move**:
   - **Cost**: 
     - **Distance Cost**: The distance traveled from the current location to the target location.
     - **Weight Cost**: \( \alpha \times \text{weight of rocks at current location} \), where \( \alpha \) is the tradeoff parameter converting weight units to distance units.
   - **Battery Impact**: Decreases battery level by a specified amount based on the map's cost for that square.
   - **Time**: The time required to traverse from the current location to the target location, as indicated on the map.

3. **Pick-up-Rock**:
   - **Cost**: 
     - **Weight Cost**: Adds the weight of the rock at the current location to the total weight of collected rocks.
     - **Distance Cost**: 0 (since it doesn't involve moving)
   - **Battery Impact**: Decreases battery level by 1 unit.
   - **Time**: Negligible compared to other actions, but can be considered as a small constant if needed.

### Combined Cost Function

For each action, the cost function should consider both immediate and future impacts:

- **Charge**:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_{\text{charge}} = \text{Time spent charging}
  \]

- **Move**:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_{\text{move}} = \text{Distance to target} + \alpha \times \text{weight of rocks at current location} + \text{Battery cost for moving}
  \]

- **Pick-up-Rock**:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_{\text{pick-up-rock}} = \alpha \times \text{weight of rock at current location} + 1 \text{ (battery unit)}
  \]

### Additional Considerations

- **Heuristic Function**: Use an admissible heuristic to estimate the remaining cost to achieve the goal. This could be based on the minimum distance to collect all required rock types and return to the lander.
  
- **Constraints**:
  - Ensure the rover returns to the lander within three days.
  - Maintain battery levels above zero at all times.
  - Collect one of each type of rock.

By defining these cost functions, we can use an A* search algorithm with a heuristic that estimates the remaining cost to achieve the goal. This approach will help in finding an optimal path that minimizes the combined cost of weight and distance while adhering to the constraints.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 5. This can be treated as a path search problem. We would like to find a heuristic. Say whether each of these possible heuristics would be useful in finding the optimal path or, if not, what's wrong with them. Let l be the number of rocks already collected. H1 : The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H2 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H3 : The distance back to the lander
//// ANSWER: To determine whether each heuristic (H1, H2, and H3) would be useful in finding an optimal path for the Mars rover problem, we need to evaluate them based on their admissibility and informativeness. An admissible heuristic is one that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal from any given node.

### Heuristic Analysis

1. **H1: The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 - l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.**

   - **Admissibility:** H1 is not admissible because it only considers the straight-line distance to the nearest uncollected rock types without accounting for the actual path that must be taken, which may include obstacles or additional travel between these points. It could underestimate the true cost if there are no direct paths.
   
   - **Usefulness:** While H1 provides some guidance by focusing on proximity to missing rocks, it lacks consideration of other factors like battery constraints and total weight, making it less reliable for finding an optimal path.

2. **H2: The length of the shortest tour through the 10 - l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.**

   - **Admissibility:** H2 is potentially admissible if it correctly accounts for all necessary paths between rock collection points and back to the lander, without overestimating the travel cost. It considers a more realistic path by attempting to find a tour.
   
   - **Usefulness:** This heuristic is more informative than H1 because it attempts to estimate the actual travel required to collect the remaining rocks. However, its effectiveness depends on accurately calculating feasible paths and considering constraints like battery life.

3. **H3: The distance back to the lander.**

   - **Admissibility:** H3 is admissible as it provides a lower bound on the cost of returning to the lander from any point. It does not overestimate because the actual return path cannot be shorter than this direct distance.
   
   - **Usefulness:** While H3 ensures that the rover considers its ability to return, it doesn't provide information about collecting missing rocks or managing battery life and weight constraints. Thus, it is useful but limited in scope for guiding the entire exploration task.

### Conclusion

- **H1** is not admissible due to potential underestimation of travel costs.
- **H2** could be admissible if implemented correctly, offering a more comprehensive estimate by considering a tour through necessary locations.
- **H3** is admissible and useful for ensuring the rover can return but lacks guidance on rock collection.

For an optimal pathfinding strategy in this problem, combining H2 with considerations of battery life, weight constraints, and possibly integrating elements from H3 could provide a more effective heuristic.

//// ANSWER: To determine which search algorithm generated each tree and whether they found the optimal path, we need to analyze the characteristics of each tree based on the given graph and scores.

### Graph Analysis:
- **Nodes and Scores**: 
  - A (1) → B (5), D (3)
  - B (2) → C (1), G (6), D (4)
  - D (1) → C (1), G (3)

### Tree G1: A → B, A → D, B → C, B → D, B → G

#### Analysis:
1. **Algorithm**:
   - The tree starts at A and explores both children B and D before going deeper into B's subtree. This suggests a non-greedy approach.
   - Since it explores all nodes at the current depth (A's children) before moving to the next level, this is indicative of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

2. **Heuristic**:
   - BFS does not use a heuristic function, so no heuristic applies here.

3. **Optimal Path**:
   - To determine if it found the least-cost path, we need to calculate the total cost from A to each node.
   - Possible paths and their costs:
     - A → B → C: 1 + 5 + 1 = 7
     - A → B → D: 1 + 5 + 4 = 10
     - A → D → C: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 (least-cost path)
   - BFS explores all nodes at each depth level, so it will eventually find the optimal path if one exists. In this case, it does find the least-cost path A → D → C.

### Conclusion for G1:
- **Algorithm**: Breadth First Search
- **Heuristic (if any)**: None
- **Did it find least-cost path?** Yes

This analysis can be applied similarly to other trees (G2-G7) by examining their structure and the order of node exploration. Each tree's characteristics will help identify the search algorithm used, whether a heuristic was involved, and if the optimal path was found.

If not, why
//// ANSWER: To determine which algorithm generated the search tree labeled G2 and whether it found the optimal path, let's analyze the given tree:

**G2:**
- A (6) → B
- A (3) → D
- D (4) → C
- D → G

### 1. Algorithm:
The tree starts at node A with a score of 6 for moving to B and a score of 3 for moving to D. The next move is from D, which has a score of 4 when moving to C. This suggests that the algorithm prioritizes nodes based on their scores, indicating a heuristic-driven approach.

- **Depth First Search (DFS):** DFS would explore as far down one branch as possible before backtracking. In G2, after reaching B, it moves to D, which is not consistent with DFS.
  
- **Breadth First Search (BFS):** BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. G2 does not follow this pattern as it prioritizes based on scores.

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** UCS expands the least-cost node first, considering only path costs. The scores in G2 do not reflect cumulative path costs from A.

- **A* Search:** A* uses both path cost and heuristic to determine the next node to expand. It would consider a combination of actual cost and heuristic value.

- **Best-First (Greedy) Search:** This algorithm selects nodes based solely on their heuristic values, ignoring path costs.

Given that G2 prioritizes nodes based on scores without considering cumulative path costs, it aligns with **Best-First (Greedy) Search**.

### 2. Heuristic (if any):
Since Best-First Search is used, we need to identify which heuristic was applied:

- **Heuristic 1 (H1):** h(A) = 3, h(B) = 6, h(C) = 4, h(D) = 3
- **Heuristic 2 (H2):** h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2

The scores in G2 are:
- A to B: 6
- A to D: 3
- D to C: 4

These scores match **Heuristic 1 (H1)**.

### 3. Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why?
To determine if the path found is optimal, we need to consider the actual costs:

- Path A → B → G has a cost of 1 + 5 = 6.
- Path A → D → C has a cost of 2 + 1 = 3 (optimal).
- Path A → D → G has a cost of 2 + 3 = 5.

The Best-First Search using H1 prioritized nodes based on heuristic values, not actual path costs. It expanded to B first due to the higher heuristic value (6), missing the optimal path A → D → C with a total cost of 3. Therefore, it did **not** find the least-cost path because it was guided by heuristic values rather than cumulative path costs.

### Summary:
1. Algorithm: Best-First (Greedy) Search
2. Heuristic: H1
3. Did it find least-cost path? No, because it prioritized nodes based on heuristic values instead of actual path costs.

If not, why
//// ANSWER: To determine which algorithm generated the search tree labeled G3 and whether it found an optimal path, let's analyze the given tree:

**G3:**
- A (7) → B
- A (6) → D
- D (8) → C
- D (6) → G

### Analysis:

1. **Algorithm:**

   - The numbers next to nodes represent scores used by the algorithm.
   - In G3, the path chosen is A → D → C with a score of 8 for reaching C from D.
   - This suggests that the algorithm prioritizes paths based on some cumulative cost or heuristic value.

2. **Heuristic (if any):**

   - The scores at each node suggest they are not simply depth-first or breadth-first, as those would not use such values.
   - Uniform Cost Search uses actual path costs to determine the next node to expand. However, the scores here do not match the cumulative path costs from A:
     - A → D = 1 + 3 = 4
     - A → D → C = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
   - The score of 8 for reaching C does not correspond to any actual path cost, indicating a heuristic is involved.
   - Comparing with the given heuristics:
     - H1: h(A) = 3, h(B) = 6, h(C) = 4, h(D) = 3
     - H2: h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2
   - The score for D (8) suggests a heuristic value is added to the path cost:
     - A → D = 4 + h(D) = 4 + 4 (using H1)
     - A → D → C = 5 + h(C) = 5 + 3 (using H1)
   - This matches H1, where h(D) = 3 and h(C) = 4.

3. **Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why:**

   - The actual least-cost path from A to G is A → B → C with a cost of 7.
   - The chosen path in G3 is A → D → C with a score of 8 (using H1).
   - The algorithm did not find the least-cost path because it used a heuristic that prioritized nodes based on estimated total cost to goal rather than actual path costs alone. This is characteristic of A* search, which uses both path cost and heuristic estimates.

### Conclusion:

1. **Algorithm:** A* Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** H1: { h(A) = 3, h(B) = 6, h(C) = 4, h(D) = 3 }
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:** No, because the heuristic influenced the search to prioritize nodes based on estimated total cost rather than actual path costs alone.

This analysis shows that G3 was generated using A* Search with heuristic H1 and did not find the optimal path due to the influence of the heuristic.

Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G4: A (3) → B A (2) → D D (0) → C C → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why
//// ANSWER: To determine the algorithm used to generate tree G4 and assess whether it found the least-cost path, let's analyze the given search trace:

### Tree G4:
- **Nodes Visited:** A → B, A → D, D → C, C → G
- **Scores:**
  - A (3)
  - B (2)
  - D (0)
  - C (1)

#### Analysis:

1. **Algorithm Identification:**

   The scores next to the nodes suggest that they are heuristic values used by a search algorithm. Let's consider each type of search mentioned:

   - **Depth First Search (DFS):** DFS would explore as far down one branch as possible before backtracking, without considering node scores.
   
   - **Breadth First Search (BFS):** BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It does not use scores for decision-making.

   - **Uniform Cost Search:** This algorithm expands the least-cost node first and uses actual path costs, not heuristic values.

   - **A* Search:** A* combines path cost (g) with a heuristic estimate of the remaining cost to the goal (h), using g + h as its priority value. It requires both actual path costs and heuristic values.

   - **Best-First (Greedy) Search:** This algorithm uses only the heuristic value (h) to decide which node to expand next, ignoring the path cost from the start node.

   In G4, the nodes are expanded based on their scores, which aligns with how Best-First (Greedy) Search operates. The search expands A → D because D has a lower score (0) compared to B (2), indicating that only heuristic values are considered.

2. **Heuristic Function:**

   Since G4 uses heuristic values, we need to identify which heuristic was used:

   - **H1:** h(A) = 3, h(B) = 6, h(C) = 4, h(D) = 3
   - **H2:** h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2

   The scores in G4 are:
   - A (3)
   - B (2)
   - D (0)
   - C (1)

   These scores match **H2**: h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2.

3. **Optimality of Path:**

   Best-First Search does not guarantee an optimal path because it only considers heuristic values and ignores the actual cost from the start node to the current node. In this case:

   - The path A → D → C → G has a total link cost of 1 (A→D) + 1 (D→C) = 2.
   - However, the path A → B → C → G has a total link cost of 2 (A→B) + 3 (B→C) = 5.

   The optimal path in terms of least-cost is A → D → C → G with a cost of 2. In this instance, Best-First Search using H2 did find the least-cost path by coincidence, but it does not guarantee optimality in general.

### Conclusion for G4:

1. **Algorithm:** Best-First (Greedy) Search
2. **Heuristic:** H2: { h(A) = 3, h(B) = 3, h(C) = 0, h(D) = 2 }
3. **Did it find the least-cost path?** Yes, in this case, but Best-First Search does not guarantee optimality.

This analysis shows that G4 was generated using a Best-First (Greedy) Search with heuristic H2 and found the least-cost path by coincidence.

If not, why?
//// ANSWER: To determine which algorithm generated tree G5 and whether it found the optimal path, let's analyze the search trace:

### G5 Trace:
- **A (1) → B**
- **A (3) → D**
- **B (5) → C**
- **B (6) → G**
- **C (1) → G**

#### Analysis:

1. **Algorithm: Best-first (Greedy) Search**
   - In best-first search, nodes are expanded based on the heuristic value alone, without considering path cost.
   - The trace shows that after expanding A, both B and D are considered. However, B is chosen next because it has a higher heuristic value (6) compared to D (3).
   - This behavior aligns with greedy best-first search, which prioritizes nodes with the highest heuristic values.

2. **Heuristic: H1**
   - The heuristic values used in G5 are consistent with H1:
     - \( h(A) = 3 \)
     - \( h(B) = 6 \)
     - \( h(C) = 4 \)
     - \( h(D) = 3 \)
   - These values match the order of expansion: A → B (since B has a higher heuristic value than D).

3. **Optimal Path:**
   - The path found is A → B → C with a total cost of 1 (A to B) + 5 (B to C) = 6.
   - To determine if this is the least-cost path, consider other possible paths:
     - A → D → C has a cost of 3 (A to D) + 1 (D to C) = 4.
     - A → B → G and A → D → G have higher costs due to additional steps.
   - The optimal path from A to C is indeed A → D → C with a total cost of 4.

#### Conclusion:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first (Greedy) Search
- **Heuristic:** H1
- **Did it find the least-cost path?** No, because greedy best-first search does not consider path costs, only heuristic values. It chose B over D due to a higher heuristic value, missing the optimal path A → D → C.

This analysis shows that G5 was generated using a greedy best-first search with heuristic H1 and did not find the least-cost path due to its reliance on heuristic values rather than actual path costs.

Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
//// ANSWER: To determine which algorithm generated the search tree labeled G6 and whether it found the least-cost path, we need to analyze the structure of the tree and the scores associated with each node.

### Analysis of G6:

1. **Tree Structure:**
   - Start at A (4)
   - Expand B from A
     - From B, expand C (6), D (7), G (7)
   - Return to A and expand D (5)
     - From D, expand C (4), G (6)
   - From C, expand G (5)

2. **Scores:**
   - The scores next to nodes seem to be guiding the expansion order.
   - For B, expansions are in the order of C (6), D (7), G (7).
   - For A, after expanding B, it expands D (5) before returning to expand B's remaining children.

3. **Algorithm Identification:**
   - The scores guide the search, suggesting a heuristic-based approach.
   - The expansion from B prioritizes C over D and G, indicating a preference based on score rather than depth or breadth.
   - This pattern is characteristic of Best-First (Greedy) Search, where nodes are expanded based on the lowest heuristic value.

4. **Heuristic Analysis:**
   - Compare the scores with the given heuristics:
     - Heuristic 1: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 6 \), \( h(C) = 4 \), \( h(D) = 3 \)
     - Heuristic 2: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 3 \), \( h(C) = 0 \), \( h(D) = 2 \)
   - The scores in G6 (e.g., B's children C (6), D (7), G (7)) align with Heuristic 1, where the heuristic values are used to guide expansion.

5. **Optimality:**
   - Best-First Search is not guaranteed to find the least-cost path because it prioritizes nodes based on heuristic values rather than actual path costs.
   - In this case, G6 does not necessarily follow the lowest cumulative cost path from A to G:
     - The path A → B → C → G has a total cost of 1 (A to B) + 5 (B to C) + 1 (C to G) = 7.
     - However, the search prioritizes nodes based on heuristic values, not cumulative costs.

### Conclusion:

1. **Algorithm:** Best-First (Greedy) Search
2. **Heuristic (if any):** Heuristic 1: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 6 \), \( h(C) = 4 \), \( h(D) = 3 \)
3. **Did it find the least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No, it did not find the least-cost path because Best-First Search uses heuristic values to guide expansion rather than considering the actual cumulative cost of paths. This can lead to suboptimal paths being chosen if the heuristic does not perfectly correlate with path costs.

This analysis shows that G6 was generated using a Best-First (Greedy) Search algorithm guided by Heuristic 1, and it did not necessarily find the least-cost path due to its reliance on heuristic values rather than actual path costs.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G7: A (1) → B A (3) → D B (6) → C B (5) → D B (7) → G D (6) → C D (8) → G D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
//// ANSWER: To determine which algorithm was used to generate the search tree labeled G7 and whether it found the optimal path, let's analyze the given information:

### Analysis of G7:
- **Nodes Visited in Order**: A → B → C; A → D → C; B → D → C; B → G; D → G
- **Scores Next to Nodes**:
  - A (1) → B (6) → C (5)
  - A (3) → D (4) → C (6)
  - B (7) → G
  - D (8) → G

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Algorithm Identification**:
   - The search starts at node A and explores its children in alphabetical order: first B, then D.
   - From B, it continues to C before exploring further from D, indicating a preference for nodes with higher scores when moving deeper.
   - This pattern suggests that the algorithm prioritizes nodes based on their heuristic values rather than depth or cost.

2. **Heuristic Function**:
   - The scores at each node (e.g., B has 6, C has 5) suggest they are heuristic values guiding the search.
   - Comparing with given heuristics:
     - H1: h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3
     - H2: h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2
   - The scores match H1, where B has a heuristic value of 6 and C has 5.

3. **Optimality Check**:
   - To determine if the path found is optimal, we need to consider the actual costs from A to each node:
     - Path A → B → C: Cost = 1 (A→B) + 2 (B→C) = 3
     - Path A → D → C: Cost = 4 (A→D) + 1 (D→C) = 5
   - The path A → B → C is the least-cost path with a total cost of 3.
   - G7 explores paths based on heuristic values, not actual costs. It finds A → B → C but also explores non-optimal paths due to its greedy nature.

### Conclusion for G7:

1. **Algorithm**: Best-first (greedy) search
2. **Heuristic Used**: H1: { h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3 }
3. **Did it find the least-cost path?**
   - Yes, it found the least-cost path A → B → C with a cost of 3.
   - However, it did not guarantee optimality for all paths due to its greedy nature, as it explores based on heuristic values rather than actual costs.

In summary, G7 was generated using Best-first (greedy) search with heuristic H1 and found the least-cost path A → B → C.
