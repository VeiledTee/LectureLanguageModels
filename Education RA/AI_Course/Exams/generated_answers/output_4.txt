Q: Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks 1. Use a set of the variables above to describe the rover's state. Do not include extraneous information. 2. Specify the goal test. 3. Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used. 4. Specify a function that determines the cost of each action. charge : move : pick-up-rock : 5. This can be treated as a path search problem. We would like to find a heuristic. Say whether each of these possible heuristics would be useful in finding the optimal path or, if not, what's wrong with them. Let l be the number of rocks already collected. H1 : The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H2 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H3 : The distance back to the lander.
A: To answer the question, we need to consider the following:
- The rover has batteries that can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors.
- The rover has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square.
- The rover has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location.
- The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled.
- We are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance.
- The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander.
- We need to determine the rover's state, including the current rover location, current lander location, weight of rocks at current location, distance to lander, total battery capacity, distance to lander, total weight of currently collected rocks, cost to traverse the current location, time since last charged, time since departure from lander, current day, current battery charge level, total battery capacity, distance to lander, total weight of currently collected rocks.
- We need to specify the goal test. The goal test is to determine whether the rover has collected the desired amount of rocks and returned to the lander.
- We need to specify the actions. The actions are move, pick-up-rock, and return to lander.
- We need to determine a function that determines the cost of each action. The cost of each action is the number of rocks collected, the distance traveled, and the time spent on the action.
- We need to determine a function that determines the heuristic for finding the optimal path. The heuristic is the sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks, the length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks, and the distance back to the lander.

Here is a possible solution:
