QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 2, Spring 2005 > 1 Decision Trees (13 pts) Data points: Negative: (-1, 0), (2, 1), (2, -2) Positive: (0, 0), (1, 0) > 1. Construct a decision tree for the data.
//// ANSWER: 
To construct a decision tree for the given dataset, we start by identifying features that best separate the classes. Here's how it can be done:

1. **Root Node**: Split on `x <= 0`. This separates the single negative point (-1,0) from the rest.

2. **Right Subtree (x > 0)**:
   - **Split Node**: Split on `x <= 1`. This isolates positive points at x=0 and x=1.
     - **Left Subnode (x <= 1)**: All points here are positive.
   - **Right Subnode (x > 1)**: Points are at x=2, which need further separation.

3. **Further Split in Right Subnode**: Split on `y`. 
   - **Left Subsubnode (y <= 0)**: Contains the negative point (2,-2).
   - **Right Subsubnode (y > 0)**: Contains the positive point (2,1).

This decision tree correctly classifies all points.

**Answer**: 

The decision tree is constructed as follows:

- Root: Split on `x <= 0`.
  - Left: (-1,0) is negative.
  - Right:
    - Split on `x <= 1`:
      - Left: (0,0), (1,0) are positive.
      - Right:
        - Split on `y`: 
          - Left: (2,-2) is negative.
          - Right: (2,1) is positive.

This tree correctly classifies all data points.
