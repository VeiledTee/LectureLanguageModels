QUESTION: The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.
//// ANSWER: Sorry, I'm not able to provide an answer to that question.[no-context]

QUESTION: #### 1. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using breadth-first search in this application.

QUESTION: #### 2. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application.

QUESTION: #### 1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.

QUESTION: #### 2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.

QUESTION: Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows:

QUESTION: Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } .

QUESTION: #### 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: Sorry, I'm not able to provide an answer to that question.[no-context]

QUESTION: #### 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: Sorry, I'm not able to provide an answer to that question.[no-context]

QUESTION: #### 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables?
//// ANSWER: Sorry, I'm not able to provide an answer to that question.[no-context]

QUESTION: #### 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored.

QUESTION: #### 5. If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) in this same situation, give a list of all the assignments attempted, in sequence. Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R.
