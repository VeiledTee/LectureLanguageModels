//// ANSWER: Error: AsyncClient.chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

QUESTION: #### 1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.

QUESTION: #### 2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.

QUESTION: Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows:

QUESTION: Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } .
//// ANSWER: Error: AsyncClient.chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

QUESTION: #### 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: Error: AsyncClient.chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

QUESTION: #### 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: Error: AsyncClient.chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

QUESTION: #### 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables?
//// ANSWER: Error: AsyncClient.chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

QUESTION: #### 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored.

QUESTION: ## 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points)
//// ANSWER: Error: AsyncClient.chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device_map'

QUESTION: You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time.
