    "text": "6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005\n\n1 Search Algorithms (16 points)\n\n1.1 Games\n\nThe standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree.\n\n1. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any  advantages or disadvantages of using breadth-first search in this application.\n\n  No. The alpha-beta algorithm is an optimization on min-max. Min-max inherently needs to look at the game-tree nodes below the current node (down to some pre-determined depth) in order to assign a value to that node. A breadth-first version of min-max does not make much sense. Thinking about alpha-beta instead of min-max only makes it worse, since the whole point of alpha-beta is to use min-max values from one of the earlier (left-most) sub-trees to decide that we do not need to explore some later (right-most) subtrees.\n  \n  Some answers suggested that min-max inherently needs to go all the way down\nto the leaves of the game tree, where the outcome of the game is known. This\nis not true. Typically one picks some depth of look-ahead depth and searches to\nthat depth, using the static evaluator to compute a score for the board position\nat that depth.\n\n2. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application.\n\n  Yes. Progressive-deepening involves repeated depth-first searches to increasing depths. This can be done trivially with min-max and alpha-beta as well, which also involve picking a maximum depth of lookahead in the tree. PD does waste some work, but as we saw in the notes, the extra work is a small fraction of the work that you would do anyways, especially when the branching factor is high, as it is in game trees. The advantage is that in timed situations you guarantee that you always have a reasonable move available."

    "text": "1.2 Algorithms\n\n1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown).  All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.\n\n   Progressive deepening (PD), with no visited or expanded list would probably be the best choice. All the costs are the same, so breadth-first (BF) and PD both guarantee finding the shortest path in that situation, without the overhead of uniform-cost search. Since the branching factor is high, space will be an issue, which is why we prefer PD over BF. If we were to use a visited list with PD, the space cost would be the same as BF and it would not make sense to pay the additional run-time cost of PD (repeated exploration of parts of the tree) if we give up the space advantage.\n\n2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.\n\n   Since we have variable link costs, we should use Uniform Cost search to guarantee the optimal answer. The fact that the costs are highly variable is good, since we expect that we might be able to avoid exploring sub-trees with high cost. Note that we don\u2019t necessarily have a useful heuristic and so A* may not be applicable. Using an expanded list would make sense if the search space involves lots of loops, which would lead us to re-visit the same state many times. However, since we know that there\u2019s a relatively short path to the goal, it might not be worth the extra space. \n\n2"

The heuristic is admissible because it is less than or equal to the actual shortest \n   distance to the goal.\n\n2. Is the heuristic given in Problem 2 consistent? Explain.\n\n   No, the heuristic is not consistent. There are two places in the graph where consistency \n   fails. One is between A and C where the drop in heuristic is 4, but the path length is   \n   only 3. The other is between B and C where the drop in heuristic is 3 but the path \n   length is only 1.\n\n3. Did the A* algorithm with strict expanded list find the optimal path in the previous \n   example? If it did find the optimal path, explain why you would expect that. If it \n   didn't find the optimal path, explain why you would expect that and give a simple \n   (specific) change of state values of the heuristic that would be sufficient to get the \n   correct behavior.\n\n   A* with a strict expanded list will not find the shortest path (which is ABCHG with \n   cost 5). This is because the heuristic is not consistent. We can make the heuristic \n   consistent by changing its value at C to be 3. There are other valid ways to make the \n   graph consistent (change h(B) to 2 and h(A) to 3, for example) and those were right \n   as well.\n\n3"

Each job has a maximum running time R_i. We will assume that jobs (on any machines) can only be started at some pre-specified times T_k. Also, there's a T_max time by which all the jobs must be finished running; that is, start time + running time is less than or equal to max time. For now, we assume that any machine can execute any job.\n\nLet's assume that we attack the problem by using the jobs as variables and using values that are each a pair (M_j, T_k). Here is a simple example.\n\n- Running time of J_1 is R_1 = 2\n- Running time of J_2 is R_2 = 4\n- Running time of J_3 is R_2 = 3\n- Running time of J_4 is R_4 = 3\n- Starting times T_k = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\n- Two available machines M_1 and M_2.\n- The max time is T_max = 7.\n- An assignment would look like J_1 = (M_2, 2), that is, run job J_1 on machine M_2 starting at time 2.\n\n1. What are the constraints for this type of CSP problem? Write a boolean expression (using logical connectives and arithmetic operations) that must be satisfied by the assignments to each pair of variables. In particular:\n\n  * J_i with value (M_j, T_k)\n  * J_m with value (M_n, T_p)\n\nThere is a unary constraint on legal values for a single variable: T_k + R_i \u2264 T_max. This is not a binary constraint on pairs of values.\n\nThe binary constraint is the one that says that jobs on the same machines must not overlap in time. It can be expressed as:\n\nM_j = M_n \u2192 T_k + R_i \u2264 T_p \u2228 T_p + R_m \u2264 T_k\n\nSo, either the machines are different or the times don\u2019t overlap."
