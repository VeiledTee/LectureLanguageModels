QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 1. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using breadth-first search in this application.
//// ANSWER: No, the alpha-beta pruning algorithm cannot be directly generalized to perform a breadth-first exploration of the game tree and still guarantee an optimal answer.

### Explanation:
1. **Alpha-Beta Algorithm**:
   - The standard alpha-beta algorithm is designed for depth-first search (DFS) with pruning. It explores the game tree level by level, starting from the root node down to a pre-specified depth.
   - Alpha-beta uses heuristics and pruning techniques to reduce the number of nodes evaluated, making it efficient in practice.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - BFS explores all nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This means that every node at a given depth is expanded before any node at the next depth.
   - BFS does not use pruning and evaluates all nodes in each layer, which can be computationally expensive for large game trees.

### Why Alpha-Beta Cannot Directly Use BFS:
- **Efficiency**: The primary advantage of alpha-beta over simple DFS is its ability to prune branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution. BFS does not have this capability; it evaluates all nodes at each level, which can be very inefficient.
- **Optimality**: While alpha-beta guarantees optimality by exploring the tree in a depth-first manner and pruning, BFS would need to evaluate every node up to the specified depth before determining if a better move exists. This is not practical for large game trees.

### Advantages of Using BFS in this Application:
- **Completeness**: BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path (or optimal solution) in an unweighted graph or tree, which could be beneficial in certain scenarios where all moves are equally important.
- **Exploration**: BFS provides a more thorough exploration of the game state space, ensuring that no potential move is overlooked.

### Disadvantages:
- **Computational Cost**: Evaluating every node at each level can be computationally expensive and impractical for large games with complex trees.
- **Memory Usage**: Storing all nodes at each depth level requires significant memory, which can become a bottleneck in real-time applications.

In summary, while BFS provides a thorough exploration of the game tree, it is not suitable for alpha-beta pruning due to its lack of efficiency and computational cost. The standard alpha-beta algorithm remains more efficient for optimal solution finding in games with large state spaces.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.1 Games The standard alpha-beta algorithm performs a depth-first exploration (to a pre-specified depth) of the game tree. > 2. Can alpha-beta be generalized to do a progressive-deepening exploration of the game tree and still get the optimal answer? Explain how or why not. If it can be generalized, indicate any advantages or disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application.
//// ANSWER: Yes, alpha-beta pruning can indeed be generalized to perform a progressive-deepening exploration (PDS) of the game tree and still get the optimal answer. This approach is known as Progressive Deepening Alpha-Beta (PDAB).

### How Progressive-Deepening Alpha-Beta Works:
1. **Initial Depth**: Start with an initial depth \( d \).
2. **Alpha-Beta Search**: Perform a standard alpha-beta search up to this initial depth.
3. **Iterative Deepening**: If the search does not find a solution, increase the depth by one and repeat the process.
4. **Termination Condition**: Continue increasing the depth until either a solution is found or an allotted time limit is reached.

### Advantages of Using Progressive-Deepening Search in Alpha-Beta:
1. **Efficiency with Time Constraints**: By starting with a shallow search and gradually deepening, PDAB ensures that if no optimal move is found within a certain time frame, the algorithm will still have explored deeper nodes than a single fixed-depth search.
2. **Optimal Moves Early On**: Even though the initial searches are shallow, they can still yield good moves early on, which might be sufficient for practical purposes.
3. **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: PDAB balances between exploring more of the tree (which is beneficial in large trees) and exploiting known good moves from previous iterations.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Increased Overhead**: The overhead of repeatedly performing alpha-beta searches at different depths can be significant, especially if the initial depth is low.
2. **Complexity Management**: Managing the iterative deepening process adds complexity to the algorithm implementation, which might not always be desirable in real-time applications.
3. **Potential for Inefficient Exploration**: If the optimal solution lies very close to the root of the tree, PDAB might still perform multiple shallow searches before reaching a deeper level.

### Ratio of Time Spent:
The ratio of time spent on PDS compared to average time spent on a single DFS with depth \( d \) is given by:

\[
\frac{\text{time for PDS}}{\text{Avg time for DFS}} \approx \frac{b + 1}{b - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( b \) is the branching factor of the game tree.
- The approximation holds under the assumption that each depth level takes roughly the same amount of time to explore.

### Conclusion:
Progressive-deepening search can be effectively applied to alpha-beta pruning, providing a flexible and efficient way to handle large and complex game trees. While it introduces some complexity in implementation, the benefits in terms of optimal move generation and efficient use of computational resources make it a valuable approach for many applications, especially under time constraints.

In summary, PDAB is not only feasible but also advantageous in scenarios where deep search is necessary but cannot be performed all at once due to time or resource limitations.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 1. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). All the actions have the same cost. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: Given the scenario where you are faced with a path search problem characterized by a very large branching factor but where the answers always involve a relatively short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown) and all actions have the same cost, the optimal search algorithm to use would be **Uniform-Cost Search**.

### Explanation:
1. **Large Branching Factor**: This suggests that using a breadth-first search or uniform-cost search could be more efficient than depth-first search because these algorithms can explore multiple paths simultaneously without getting stuck in deep but non-optimal branches.
   
2. **Short Sequence of Actions**: Since the optimal path involves only a short sequence of actions, and all actions have the same cost, Uniform-Cost Search is well-suited. This algorithm expands nodes based on their cumulative cost from the start node, ensuring that it will find the shortest (in terms of number of steps) path first.

3. **Uniform Cost**: The fact that all actions have the same cost means that minimizing the total cost directly translates to finding the shortest path in terms of the number of steps. Uniform-Cost Search is guaranteed to find the optimal solution under these conditions because it always expands the least-cost node next, ensuring that when a goal state is reached, it has been reached with the minimum possible cost.

### When to Use Visited or Expanded List:
- **Visited/Expanded List**: In this specific scenario, using an expanded list (which tracks nodes that have already been processed) can be beneficial. This helps avoid revisiting nodes and ensures that you do not waste computational resources on paths that have already been explored.
  
  - **Conditions for Using Visited List**:
    - To prevent cycles in the graph, especially if there are loops or repeated states.
    - To ensure that each node is processed only once, which can significantly reduce the number of redundant computations.

### Summary:
- **Algorithm to Use**: Uniform-Cost Search
- **Visited/Expanded List**: Yes, it would be a good idea to maintain an expanded list to avoid revisiting nodes and ensuring efficient exploration of the search space.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 1 Search Algorithms (16 points) > 1.2 Algorithms > 2. You are faced with a path search problem with a very large branching factor, but where the answers always involve a relative short sequence of actions (whose exact length is unknown). These actions, however, have widely varying costs. What search algorithm would you use to find the optimal answer? Indicate under what conditions, if any, a visited or expanded list would be a good idea.
//// ANSWER: For the given scenario in 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005, where you are faced with a path search problem characterized by a very large branching factor but where the optimal solution involves a relatively short sequence of actions with widely varying costs, the appropriate search algorithm to use would be **A* (A-star)**.

### Why A*?
- **Heuristic Guidance**: A* uses a heuristic function \( h(n) \), which estimates the remaining cost from node \( n \) to the goal. This helps in guiding the search towards the goal more efficiently, especially when the exact length of the optimal path is unknown.
- **Cost Consideration**: Since actions have widely varying costs, A* can handle this by incorporating both the actual cost so far (\( g(n) \)) and the heuristic estimate (\( h(n) \)). The total cost for a node \( n \) is given by \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \).
- **Optimality**: Under certain conditions, A* can guarantee finding the optimal path. Specifically, if the heuristic function \( h(n) \) is admissible (never overestimates the true cost to the goal), and consistent (satisfies the triangle inequality), then A* will find the shortest path.

### When to Use a Visited or Expanded List
- **Visited List**: It would be beneficial to maintain a visited list in this scenario. The large branching factor means that many nodes might be expanded multiple times, leading to redundant work if not tracked. By keeping track of visited nodes, you can avoid revisiting them and thus save computational resources.
- **Expanded List**: An expanded list (which is essentially the same as a visited list) would also be useful here. Keeping track of which nodes have been expanded helps in pruning future expansions from those nodes, further optimizing the search.

### Summary
**Algorithm to Use: A***
- **Conditions for Using Visited or Expanded List**: Always maintain a visited/expanded list due to the large branching factor and potential redundancy in node expansion.

This approach ensures that you efficiently explore the vast state space while leveraging the heuristic to guide your search towards the goal, making it well-suited for problems with high branching factors but relatively short optimal paths.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 1. If we run full constraint propagation on the initial state, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: To solve this problem using constraint satisfaction (CSP) and to determine the resulting domains after running full constraint propagation on the initial state, let's first set up the constraints for the 3x3 checkerboard.

### Initial Setup:
- Variables: V1, V2, V3, V4, V5
- Domains: {R, B} (Red and Black)
- Constraints: Squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally must not have the same color.

The board is laid out as follows:

```
V1 | V2 | V3
---------
V4 | V5 |
```

### Initial State:
All variables start with domains {R, B}.

### Constraint Propagation:
We will propagate constraints to reduce the domains of each variable based on its neighbors. Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Variable V1:**
   - Neighbors: V2
   - Possible assignments after propagation: If V2 is assigned R, then V1 must be B; if V2 is assigned B, then V1 must be R.
   
2. **Variable V2:**
   - Neighbors: V1, V3, V5
   - Possible assignments after propagation: 
     - If V1 is assigned R, then V2 must be B.
     - If V1 is assigned B, then V2 must be R.
     - If V3 is assigned R, then V2 must be B.
     - If V3 is assigned B, then V2 must be R.
     - If V5 is assigned R or B (initially), no immediate change.

3. **Variable V3:**
   - Neighbors: V2
   - Possible assignments after propagation: 
     - If V2 is assigned R, then V3 must be B.
     - If V2 is assigned B, then V3 must be R.
   
4. **Variable V4:**
   - Neighbors: V5
   - Possible assignments after propagation: 
     - If V5 is assigned R or B (initially), no immediate change.

5. **Variable V5:**
   - Neighbors: V2, V4
   - Possible assignments after propagation:
     - If V2 is assigned R, then V5 must be B.
     - If V2 is assigned B, then V5 must be R.
     - If V4 is assigned R or B (initially), no immediate change.

### Resulting Domains After Full Constraint Propagation:

- **V1:** Initially {R, B}. After propagation, it depends on the value of V2. Let's assume an initial assignment for simplicity:
  - Suppose V2 = R, then V1 must be B.
  - If V2 = B, then V1 must be R.

- **V2:** Initially {R, B}. After propagation, based on its neighbors:
  - If V1 is assigned R, then V2 must be B.
  - If V1 is assigned B, then V2 must be R.
  - If V3 is assigned R, then V2 must be B.
  - If V3 is assigned B, then V2 must be R.

- **V3:** Initially {R, B}. After propagation:
  - If V2 is assigned R, then V3 must be B.
  - If V2 is assigned B, then V3 must be R.

- **V4:** Initially {R, B}. No immediate change after propagation since it only has one neighbor (V5).

- **V5:** Initially {R, B}. After propagation:
  - If V2 is assigned R, then V5 must be B.
  - If V2 is assigned B, then V5 must be R.

### Summary of Resulting Domains:

1. **V1:** {B} if V2 = R; {R} if V2 = B
2. **V2:** {B} if V1 = R or V3 = R; {R} if V1 = B or V3 = B
3. **V3:** {B} if V2 = R; {R} if V2 = B
4. **V4:** {R, B}
5. **V5:** {B} if V2 = R; {R} if V2 = B

These are the resulting domains after running full constraint propagation on the initial state of the 3x3 checkerboard problem with the given constraints.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 2. Say, instead, the initial domain of variable 5 is restricted to { B } , with the other domains as before. If we now run full constraint propagation, what are the resulting domains of the variables?
//// ANSWER: Given the constraints and the initial conditions provided, let's simulate the process of constraint propagation step-by-step for the 3x3 checkerboard problem with variable 5 initially restricted to {B}.

### Initial Setup:
- Variables: V1 (1), V2 (2), V3 (3), V4 (4), V5 (5)
- Domains: 
  - V1, V2, V3, V4: {R, B}
  - V5: {B}

### Step-by-Step Constraint Propagation:

1. **Variable V5 = B**:
   - Since V5 is assigned the value B, we need to propagate this assignment to its neighbors (V2 and V4) because they are adjacent horizontally.

2. **Propagate from V5 to V2**:
   - V2 cannot be B since it's adjacent to V5 which is B.
   - Therefore, V2's domain becomes {R}.

3. **Propagate from V5 to V4**:
   - V4 cannot be B since it's adjacent to V5 which is B.
   - Therefore, V4's domain becomes {R}.

### Resulting Domains After Full Constraint Propagation:

- V1: {R, B}
- V2: {R}
- V3: {R, B}
- V4: {R}
- V5: {B}

This is the result after running full constraint propagation starting with variable 5 restricted to {B}. The domains of the other variables have been updated based on their adjacency constraints.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 3. If in the initial state (all variables have domains { R, B } ), we assign variable 1 to R and do forward checking, what are the resulting domains of the other variables?
//// ANSWER: Given the constraints that adjacent squares on a checkerboard cannot share the same color, let's analyze the effect of assigning Variable 1 (Square 1) to Red (R) and then perform forward checking.

### Initial State:
- All variables have domains { R, B }.
- Variables: V1, V2, V4, V5

### Assignment:
- Assign \( V_1 = R \)

### Forward Checking:
Forward checking involves propagating the assignment of \( V_1 = R \) to its neighbors and reducing their domains accordingly. The neighbors of \( V_1 \) are \( V_2 \), \( V_4 \), and \( V_5 \).

- **Square 2 (V2)**: Since \( V_2 \) is adjacent to \( V_1 \), it cannot be Red (R). Therefore, the domain of \( V_2 \) will be reduced to { B }.
- **Square 4 (V4)**: Similarly, since \( V_4 \) is adjacent to \( V_1 \), its domain will also be reduced to { B }.
- **Square 5 (V5)**: Since \( V_5 \) is adjacent to both \( V_1 \) and \( V_4 \), it cannot be Red. Therefore, the domain of \( V_5 \) will be reduced to { B }.

### Resulting Domains:
After performing forward checking with the initial assignment \( V_1 = R \):

- **\( V_2 \)**: Domain is { B }
- **\( V_4 \)**: Domain is { B }
- **\( V_5 \)**: Domain is { B }

Thus, the resulting domains of the other variables are:
- \( V_2 \): { B }
- \( V_4 \): { B }
- \( V_5 \): { B }

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B). We will limit our discussion to five squares on a 3x3 board, numbered as follows: 1 | 2 | 3 ---------- 4 | 5 | ---------- |   | Let's look at the CSP formulation of this problem. Let the squares be the variables and the colors be the values. All the variables have domains { R, B } . > 4. Assume that during backtracking we first attempt assigning variables to R and then to B. Assume, also, that we examine the variables in numerical order, starting with 1. Also, let the domain of variable 5 be { B } , the other domains are { R, B } . In the following tree, which shows the space of assignments to the 5 variables we care about, indicate how pure backtracking (BT) would proceed by placing a check mark next to any assignment that would be attempted during the search and crossing out the nodes where a constraint test would fail. Leave unmarked those nodes that would never be explored. RB RBRB RBRBRBRB RBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
//// ANSWER: To solve the given problem using pure backtracking (BT) search, we need to follow the steps as described in the context. Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Variables: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Domains:
     - Domain of variable 5 is {B}.
     - Other variables have domains {R, B}.

2. **Backtracking Search Order:**
   - We start with variable 1 and assign it R or B in that order.
   - Then we move to the next variable (2) and so on, examining assignments in numerical order.

3. **Constraint Graph:**
   - The constraint is that adjacent squares cannot have the same color.

4. **Tree Representation:**
   - We will represent the tree as a sequence of assignments for variables 1 through 5.
   - Nodes are marked with checks if they would be attempted and crossed out if a constraint test fails.

Let's construct the tree based on these rules:

```
R
├── B (fails, cross out)
│
RB
├── R (fails, cross out)
│
RBR
├── B (fails, cross out)
│
RBRB
├── R (fails, cross out)
│
RBRBR
├── B (fails, cross out)
│
RBRBRB
└── B (valid assignment, check mark)

```

Now let's examine the tree step by step:

1. **Start with variable 1:**
   - Assign R to variable 1.
     - Path: RB

2. **Move to variable 2:**
   - Assign B to variable 2 (fails constraint, cross out).
     - Path: RBR (crossed out)

3. **Backtrack to variable 1 and assign B:**
   - Path: RB
     - Move to variable 2: Assign R to variable 2 (fails constraint, cross out).
       - Path: RBRB (crossed out)
     - Backtrack to variable 1 and assign R.
       - Path: RBRBR

4. **Move to variable 3:**
   - Assign B to variable 3 (fails constraint, cross out).
     - Path: RBRBRB (crossed out)

5. **Backtrack to variable 2 and assign R:**
   - Path: RBR
     - Move to variable 3: Assign B to variable 3.
       - Path: RBRB
         - Move to variable 4: Assign R to variable 4 (fails constraint, cross out).
           - Path: RBRBR (crossed out)
         - Backtrack to variable 3 and assign B.
           - Path: RBRBB

6. **Move to variable 5:**
   - Domain of variable 5 is {B}.
     - Assign B to variable 5.
       - Path: RBRBBB (valid assignment, check mark)

7. **Backtrack further if needed:**
   - Continue backtracking and exploring other paths as necessary.

The final tree with checks and crosses would look like this:

```
R
├── B (cross out)
│
RB
├── R (cross out)
│
RBR
├── B (cross out)
│
RBRB
├── R (cross out)
│
RBRBR
└── B (valid assignment, check mark)

```

In this tree:
- Nodes with a check mark represent assignments that would be attempted during the search.
- Nodes crossed out represent assignments where a constraint test failed.

This process ensures we explore all possible valid colorings of the board while respecting the constraints.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 2 Constraints (16 points) Consider assigning colors to a checkerboard so that squares that are adjacent vertically or horizontally do not have the same color. We know that this can be done with only two colors, say red (R) and black (B).

//// ANSWER: Given the constraints and the CSP formulation provided, let's walk through the sequence of assignments attempted using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC). The goal is to assign colors R (red) or B (black) to squares such that no two adjacent squares share the same color. We will follow the domains as they evolve during the search process.

### Initial State:
- **Domain of 1:** {R, B}
- **Domain of 2:** {R, B}
- **Domain of 3:** {R, B}
- **Domain of 4:** {R, B}
- **Domain of 5:** {B}

### Step-by-step Assignments:

1. **Assignment: 1 = R**
   - Domain of 1: {R} (fixed to R)
   
2. **Forward Checking: Propagate from 1= R**
   - Domain of 2: {B} (cannot be R, adjacent to 1=R)
   - Domain of 4: {B} (cannot be R, adjacent to 1=R)

3. **Assignment: 2 = B**
   - Domain of 2: {B} (fixed to B)
   
4. **Forward Checking: Propagate from 2= B**
   - Domain of 3: {R} (cannot be B, adjacent to 2=B)
   - Domain of 5: {} (no valid color for 5, as it is adjacent to 1=R and 2=B)

Since the domain of square 5 becomes empty, we need to backtrack:

5. **Backtrack from 5 = B**
   - Revert 5's assignment
   - Domain of 5: {B}

6. **Reassign 4 = R** (since 4's domain was {B} and now needs to be reassigned)
   - Domain of 4: {R}
   
7. **Forward Checking: Propagate from 4= R**
   - Domain of 3: {} (no valid color for 3, as it is adjacent to both 2=B and 4=R)

Since the domain of square 3 becomes empty, we need to backtrack again:

8. **Backtrack from 3 = R**
   - Revert 3's assignment
   - Domain of 3: {R, B}

9. **Reassign 2 = R** (since 2's domain was {B} and now needs to be reassigned)
   - Domain of 2: {R}
   
10. **Forward Checking: Propagate from 2= R**
    - Domain of 3: {B} (cannot be R, adjacent to 2=R)
    - Domain of 5: {B} (cannot be R, adjacent to 4=R)

At this point, we have a valid assignment for all squares:

11. **Assignment: 3 = B**
    - Domain of 3: {B} (fixed to B)
    
12. **Assignment: 5 = B**
    - Domain of 5: {B} (fixed to B)

Thus, the sequence of assignments attempted using backtracking with forward checking is:

- 1 = R
- 2 = B
- 3 = R
- 4 = R
- 5 = B

This results in a valid coloring where no two adjacent squares share the same color.

Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None     | 5 = B    | 2= R   | 1= B   | 3= B   | 4= R   | |---------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R, B } | { R }    |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  | { B }  |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R, B } | { R }    | { R }  | { R }  | { R }  |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }    |          |        |        |        |        | { }
//// ANSWER: Given the constraints and the provided CSP formulation, let's walk through the sequence of variable assignments using backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) and dynamic variable ordering based on the most-constrained-variable strategy. We will use the notation `variable = color` for each assignment.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial State:**
   - All squares have domains `{ R, B }`.
   
2. **Variable Selection:**
   - The first variable to be selected is 5 (since it has the most constraints initially).

3. **Assignment 1:**
   - Assign `5 = B`.

4. **Forward Checking for Variable 5:**
   - After assigning `5 = B`, the domains of adjacent variables are updated:
     - Domain of 2 becomes `{ R }` (cannot be `B`).
     - Domain of 4 becomes `{ R }` (cannot be `B`).

5. **Variable Selection:**
   - The next variable to be selected is 2 or 4, both having the most constraints and lowest-numbered.

6. **Assignment 2:**
   - Assign `2 = R`.

7. **Forward Checking for Variable 2:**
   - After assigning `2 = R`, the domain of adjacent variables are updated:
     - Domain of 1 becomes `{ B }` (cannot be `R`).
     - Domain of 3 becomes `{ B }` (cannot be `R`).

8. **Variable Selection:**
   - The next variable to be selected is 1 or 3, both having the most constraints and lowest-numbered.

9. **Assignment 3:**
   - Assign `1 = B`.

10. **Forward Checking for Variable 1:**
    - After assigning `1 = B`, the domain of adjacent variables are updated:
      - Domain of 2 is already `{ R }` (unchanged).
      - Domain of 4 is already `{ R }` (unchanged).

11. **Variable Selection:**
    - The next variable to be selected is 3, as it has the most constraints and lowest-numbered.

12. **Assignment 4:**
    - Assign `3 = B`.

13. **Forward Checking for Variable 3:**
    - After assigning `3 = B`, the domain of adjacent variables are updated:
      - Domain of 2 is already `{ R }` (unchanged).
      - Domain of 4 is already `{ R }` (unchanged).

14. **Variable Selection:**
    - The next variable to be selected is 4, as it has the most constraints and lowest-numbered.

15. **Assignment 5:**
    - Assign `4 = R`.

### Summary of Variable Assignments:
- Assignment sequence: 
  - 5 = B
  - 2 = R
  - 1 = B
  - 3 = B
  - 4 = R

This sequence represents the variable assignments attempted using backtracking with forward checking and dynamic variable ordering based on the most-constrained-variable strategy.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists. There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: ### Formulation A: The Variables Are the 3k Instrument/Time Slots

#### 1. Value Domain for the Variables
For each of the 3k instrument/time slot variables, the domain consists of all possible observations that can be scheduled at a given time and with a specific instrument.

#### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables (in terms of k, m, and n)
- Each variable corresponds to an observation, which is specified by a target, an instrument, and a time slot.
- The number of possible observations per scientist is \(n\).
- Since there are \(m\) scientists, the total number of distinct observations that can be made is \(mn\).

Thus, each of the 3k variables has a domain size of \(mn\).

#### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation
- **C2 (At most one observation per instrument per time slot):** This constraint is naturally satisfied because each variable represents an individual observation, and there are no other constraints that would allow multiple observations to be assigned to the same instrument/time slot.

#### 4. Whether Constraints Can Be Specified as Binary Constraints in this Formulation
- **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made):** This constraint cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint because it involves ensuring that exactly two out of \(n\) possible choices are selected for each scientist, which is a global constraint over multiple variables.
- **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):** This can potentially be specified using binary constraints. For example, if we consider all pairs of instrument/time slots and define a binary variable that indicates whether two specific observations share the same target, this could be used to enforce the constraint.

### Detailed Explanation

- **C1 (Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made):**
  - This is a global constraint because it involves ensuring that exactly two out of \(n\) possible choices are selected for each of the \(m\) scientists.
  - Binary constraints can only directly enforce relationships between pairs of variables, making it challenging to implement this constraint without additional auxiliary variables or more complex formulations.

- **C3 (The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target):**
  - This can be enforced using binary constraints by defining a variable that indicates whether two specific observations share the same target.
  - For example, if we denote \(x_{ij}\) as the observation at instrument \(i\) and time slot \(j\), we could define a binary variable \(y_{ijk}\) such that \(y_{ijk} = 1\) if both \(x_{ij}\) and \(x_{jk}\) share the same target, and use this to enforce the constraint.

### Conclusion
- **C1** cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint in this formulation.
- **C3** can potentially be enforced using binary constraints by defining appropriate auxiliary variables.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot.

There are k total time slots, and the telescope has three instruments, but all must be aimed at the same target at the same time. The greedy scientists cannot all be satisfied, so we will try to find a schedule that satisfies the following constraints: C1 . Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (the choice of the two will be part of the solution). C2 . At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. C3 . The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. Note that for some set of requested observations, there may not be any consistent schedule, but that's fine. Consider the following three formulations of the problem. A . The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. B . The variables are the m scientists. C . The variables are the mn scientists' requests. For each formulation, specify 1 . The value domain for the variables. 2 . The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of k , m ,and n ). 3 . Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: ### Formulation A: The Variables Are the 3k Instrument/Time Slots

1. **The Value Domain for the Variables**:
   - Each variable represents an assignment of one observation to a specific instrument at a specific time slot.
   - Since each scientist can have up to two observations, and there are \(m\) scientists, the domain for each variable would be \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), where:
     - \(0\) means no observation is scheduled,
     - \(1\) means one of the two possible observations from a particular scientist is scheduled,
     - \(2\) means both of the two possible observations from a particular scientist are scheduled.

2. **Size of the Domain for the Variables**:
   - The domain size for each variable is 3, as mentioned above.
   - Since there are \(3k\) such variables (one for each instrument/time slot combination), and each has a domain of size 3, we can say that the total number of values across all domains is \(3 \times 3k = 9k\).

3. **Which of the Constraints Are Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation**:
   - Constraint C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot) will be inherently satisfied because each variable represents a specific instrument/time slot combination, and only one value can be assigned to each variable.
   - Constraint C3 (the observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) is not directly enforced by this formulation. It would need additional constraints or logic to ensure that all observations at a given time slot share the same target.

4. **Whether the Constraints Can Be Specified as Binary Constraints in This Formulation**:
   - Constraint C1 (exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) can be specified using binary constraints.
     - For each scientist, we need to ensure that exactly one of their two possible observations is selected at some time slot. We can use a combination of binary constraints and additional logic to enforce this.
   - Constraint C3 (the observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target) cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint in this formulation because it involves ensuring that all variables sharing a common time slot have the same value, which is not a pairwise relationship.

### Summary:
- **Domain Size**: 3
- **Total Domain Values**: \(9k\)
- **Constraints Satisfied**: C2 (at most one observation per instrument per time slot)
- **Binary Constraints Possible for**: C1 (exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made)
- **Not Directly Specifiable as Binary Constraints For**: C3 (the observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target)

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 3. Satisfied constraints:
//// ANSWER: For **Formulation A**, where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots:

1. **The value domain for the variables**: Each variable represents an assignment of an observation to a specific time slot and instrument combination. The domain for each variable can be considered as the set of all possible observations that could be assigned to that particular instrument/time slot.

2. **The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\))**: Since there are \(mn\) total requests from scientists, and we need to assign exactly 2 out of these for each scientist, the number of possible observations is at most \(2m\). Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable (each instrument/time slot) would be at most \(2m\).

3. **Necessarily satisfied constraints**:
   - Constraint C3: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
     - This constraint is necessarily satisfied because in this formulation, we are directly assigning observations to specific time slots and instruments. If two different observations are assigned to the same time slot and instrument, they will inherently share the same target since each observation is uniquely identified by its target.

4. **Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints**:
   - Constraint C2: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
     - Yes, this constraint can be specified as a binary constraint. For any given pair of variables representing different time slots and instruments (i.e., \((t_1, i)\) and \((t_2, i)\)), we can define a binary constraint that ensures at most one of them is assigned an observation.
   - Constraint C1: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
     - This constraint cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint. While it involves multiple variables (one for each time slot), specifying exactly which two out of \(2m\) possible observations should be selected requires more complex constraints that are not easily expressible as simple binary constraints.

In summary, for Formulation A:
- The value domain for the variables is the set of all possible observations.
- The size of the domain for each variable is at most \(2m\).
- Constraint C3 is necessarily satisfied due to the direct assignment nature in this formulation.
- Constraint C2 can be specified as binary constraints, but Constraint C1 cannot.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation A: The variables are the 3 k instrument/time slots. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation A where the variables are the \(3k\) instrument/time slots:

### 1. Value Domain for Variables
The value domain for each variable (instrument/time slot) is the set of all possible observations that can be scheduled at that time and with that instrument.

### 2. Size of the Domain for Variables
Since there are \(m\) scientists, each contributing 2 observations, and thus a total of \(2m\) observations to choose from, the size of the domain for each variable is \(2m\).

### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Due to Formulation
- **C1**: This constraint can be implicitly satisfied because we are selecting exactly two observations per scientist, which means that out of the \(3k\) variables (time slots), only a subset will be assigned values.
- **C2 and C3**: These constraints cannot be directly enforced by this formulation since they involve relationships between different time slots and instruments. However, if we were to check these constraints during the assignment process, violations would indicate an infeasible solution.

### 4. Binary Constraints?
The constraints can indeed be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. Here’s how:

- **C2**: For each instrument/time slot pair, ensure that at most one observation is scheduled.
  - This can be formulated as a binary constraint where for any two different time slots \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) with the same instrument \(i\), the variables corresponding to these time slots should not both have non-empty values. Formally, if \(V_{it_1}\) and \(V_{it_2}\) are the variables representing observations for instrument \(i\) at time slots \(t_1\) and \(t_2\), then a binary constraint can be defined as:
    \[
    V_{it_1} \neq V_{it_2}
    \]
  - This ensures that only one of these two variables is assigned a value.

- **C3**: For each time slot, ensure that the observations scheduled must have the same target.
  - This can be formulated as binary constraints between the variables representing different instruments at the same time slot. If \(V_{it_1}\) and \(V_{it_2}\) are the variables for two different instruments (say \(i_1\) and \(i_2\)) at the same time slot \(t\), then a binary constraint can be defined as:
    \[
    V_{i_1 t} = V_{i_2 t}
    \]
  - This ensures that if both variables are assigned values, they must have the same target.

### Summary
- **Binary Constraints for C2**: Ensure no two time slots with the same instrument have non-empty values.
- **Binary Constraints for C3**: Ensure all instruments at a given time slot have the same target value.

These binary constraints can be effectively used in this formulation to enforce the constraints \(C2\) and \(C3\).

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: ### Formulation B: The Variables Are the \(m\) Scientists

#### 1. Value Domain for the Variables
For each scientist, the value domain consists of all possible pairs of observations that can be selected from their list of \(n\) telescope observations. Since exactly two out of \(n\) observations must be chosen, the domain for each scientist's variable is the set of all \(\binom{n}{2}\) combinations of two observations.

#### 2. Size of the Domain
The size of the domain for each scientist’s variable can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Size} = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]

Since there are \(m\) scientists, and each has its own domain, we do not multiply these sizes together because they are independent choices for different scientists.

#### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied
The constraints that are necessarily satisfied due to the formulation include:
- **C1**: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made (this is directly enforced by the structure of the domain, as only pairs of observations can be selected).
  
However, none of C2 and C3 are necessarily satisfied because they involve interactions between different scientists' choices. These constraints require checking consistency across multiple variables.

#### 4. Binary Constraints
The constraints C2 and C3 cannot be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation. Here’s why:

- **C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
  - This constraint involves interactions between different scientists' choices, which are not directly represented by a single pair of variables (i.e., two scientists). For example, if we consider the choice of an observation for scientist \(S_1\) and another for scientist \(S_2\), there’s no direct binary relationship that can enforce C2.

- **C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
  - Similarly, this constraint involves ensuring that multiple scientists' chosen observations share the same target at a given time slot. There is no natural way to express such a constraint as a binary relation between two variables in this formulation.

### Summary
- **Domain**: Each scientist's variable has a domain of \(\binom{n}{2}\) combinations.
- **Size of Domain**: The size for each scientist’s variable is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- **Necessarily Satisfied Constraints**: Only C1 is necessarily satisfied due to the structure of the problem.
- **Binary Constraints**: Neither C2 nor C3 can be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation.

//// ANSWER: For Formulation B where the variables are the \(m\) scientists:

1. **The value domain for the variables**: 
   - Each scientist can be assigned a subset of their observations to schedule, specifically two out of the \(n\) observations they submitted.
   
2. **Size of the domain for the variables**:
   - The size of the domain for each variable (each scientist) is \(\binom{n}{2}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 observations from \(n\). This can be calculated as \(\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation**:
   - Constraint C1 is inherently satisfied by this formulation since each scientist must choose exactly 2 out of their \(n\) observations.
   
4. **Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation**:
   - Yes, Constraints C2 and C3 can be specified as binary constraints.
     - **Constraint C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. This can be modeled using a binary constraint between each pair of observations (from different scientists) that share the same target at the same time slot. If two observations are assigned to the same time slot and instrument, they must not conflict with any other observations from other scientists.
     - **Constraint C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target. This can be modeled using binary constraints between each pair of observations that share the same time slot but different targets. If two observations are assigned to the same time slot, they must have the same target.

In summary:
- For Formulation B with variables as \(m\) scientists:
  - Each scientist's domain size is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
  - Constraint C1 is inherently satisfied.
  - Both Constraints C2 and C3 can be specified using binary constraints.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation B: The variables are the m scientists. > 3. Satisfied constraints:
//// ANSWER: ### Formulation B: The Variables Are the \(m\) Scientists

#### 1. Value Domain for the Variables
For each scientist, we need to determine which two of their requested observations will be scheduled. Each observation is specified by a target, an instrument, and a time slot. Therefore, the value domain for each variable (scientist) consists of all possible pairs of their \(n\) requests.

#### 2. Size of the Domain for the Variables
The size of the domain for each scientist's variable can be calculated as follows:
- Each scientist has \(n\) observations.
- We need to choose exactly 2 out of these \(n\).
- The number of ways to choose 2 from \(n\) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

Thus, the size of the domain for each scientist's variable is:
\[ \text{Size of domain} = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]

#### 3. Satisfied Constraints
Given the formulation where variables are scientists and we need to choose exactly two observations per scientist, some constraints will be satisfied by default due to this choice:
- **C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
    - This is not necessarily satisfied because choosing 2 out of \(n\) requests does not inherently ensure that all chosen requests share the same target. However, if we can enforce this constraint through binary constraints or other means, it will be satisfied.

#### 4. Binary Constraints
To determine whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation:

- **C1**: Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made.
    - This is inherently a unary constraint (each variable has exactly one value) and does not need to be expressed as a binary constraint.

- **C2**: At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.
    - This can potentially be specified using binary constraints. For each time slot \(t\) and instrument \(i\), we can create a binary constraint that ensures at most one of the chosen observations for any scientist has this combination \((t, i)\).

- **C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target.
    - This is more complex to express as a binary constraint. It requires ensuring that if two different scientists' selected observations share the same time slot and instrument, they also share the same target. This can be enforced through additional constraints but may not directly translate into simple binary constraints.

### Summary for Formulation B
- **Value Domain**: For each scientist, \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) possible pairs of observations.
- **Domain Size**: \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)
- **Satisfied Constraints**: C3 is not necessarily satisfied by default but can be enforced through additional constraints.
- **Binary Constraints**: C2 can be specified as binary constraints, while C3 requires more complex enforcement.

This detailed analysis should provide a clear understanding of the formulation and its implications for constraint satisfaction in scheduling observations on the space telescope.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope. We have m scientists who have each submitted a list of n telescope observations they would like to make. An observation is specified by a target, a telescope instrument, and a time slot. Each scientist is working on a different project so the targets in each scientist's observations are different from those of other scientists.

### 4. Binary Constraints?

**No**, the constraints C1, C2, and C3 cannot be specified as binary constraints in this formulation.

#### Explanation:

- **Constraint C1**: "Exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made."
  - This constraint involves choosing exactly two out of \(n\) possible observations for each scientist. It is a unary constraint on the variables (scientists) because it specifies an action to be taken for each individual scientist, rather than a relationship between pairs of scientists.

- **Constraint C2**: "At most one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled."
  - This involves ensuring that no more than one observation from any scientist is assigned to the same time slot and instrument. However, in Formulation B where variables are scientists, there's no direct way to express this constraint as a binary relationship between two scientists because it requires considering multiple time slots and instruments simultaneously.

- **Constraint C3**: "The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target."
  - This involves ensuring that all observations in a given time slot share the same target. Again, since we are only considering scientists as variables here, there's no straightforward way to express this constraint using binary relationships between pairs of scientists.

#### Counterexample:

Consider two scientists \(S_1\) and \(S_2\), each with two possible observations at different times:
- \(O_{11}\) for scientist \(S_1\) at time slot 1
- \(O_{12}\) for scientist \(S_1\) at time slot 2
- \(O_{21}\) for scientist \(S_2\) at time slot 1
- \(O_{22}\) for scientist \(S_2\) at time slot 2

In a binary constraint formulation, we would need to express relationships between pairs of observations. However, Constraint C3 requires looking at all observations in a single time slot, which cannot be directly expressed as a binary relationship.

Therefore, these constraints must be handled through other means, such as global constraints or by using the variables and domains specified for Formulation A (instrument/time slots) to express them effectively.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 1. Domain:
//// ANSWER: ### Formulation C: Variables are the \(mn\) Scientists' Requests

#### 1. Domain:

For each of the \(mn\) scientists' requests, the domain consists of tuples representing the possible assignments for an observation. Each tuple includes a target (from among the total number of targets), an instrument (one of three instruments), and a time slot (from among the \(k\) time slots).

- **Target**: There are \(t\) different targets (since each scientist's observations have unique targets, and there are \(m \times n\) requests in total but only \(t\) distinct targets).
- **Instrument**: 3 possible values (one for each instrument).
- **Time Slot**: \(k\) possible time slots.

Thus, the domain for each variable (scientist's request) is a set of tuples:
\[ \{(target_i, instrument_j, time_slot_l) | 1 \leq i \leq t, 1 \leq j \leq 3, 1 \leq l \leq k\} \]

#### 2. Size of the Domain:

The size of the domain for each variable is:
\[ 3k \times t \]
This is because there are \(t\) possible targets, 3 instruments, and \(k\) time slots.

#### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Due to Formulation:

- **C1**: This constraint can be enforced by ensuring that exactly two out of the \(mn\) variables (requests) are selected for each scientist.
- **C2**: This can be handled by ensuring no more than one observation per instrument per time slot, which is a direct consequence of selecting only one tuple from the domain for each variable.

#### 4. Binary Constraints:

The constraints C1 and C3 can indeed be specified as binary constraints in this formulation.

- **Binary Constraint for C1**: For each scientist (out of \(m\)), you need exactly two out of their \(n\) requests to be selected. This can be modeled using a binary constraint that ensures the sum of the selection variables (indicating which request is chosen) equals 2.
  
- **Binary Constraint for C3**: The observations scheduled for a single time slot must have the same target, and only one observation per instrument per time slot should be active. These constraints can be enforced by ensuring that if two requests share the same time slot and instrument, they must also share the same target.

**Example of Binary Constraints:**

- For C1 (exactly 2 out of \(n\) observations for each scientist):
  - Define a binary variable \(x_{ij}\) where \(i\) is the scientist index and \(j\) is the request index.
  - Ensure \(\sum_j x_{ij} = 2\).

- For C3 (same target at same time slot):
  - If two requests share the same time slot, instrument, and are selected (\(x_{ij} = 1\)), they must have the same target.

In summary:
- The domain for each variable in formulation C is a set of \(3k \times t\) tuples.
- Constraints C1 and C3 can be specified as binary constraints due to the nature of the problem.

Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 2. Size of domain:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C, where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests, let's address each part of your question:

1. **The value domain for the variables:**
   - Each variable represents a scientist’s request and can take on one of three values corresponding to the telescope instruments (let's denote them as I1, I2, and I3).

2. **The size of the domain for the variables (in terms of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\)):**
   - The value domain is fixed at 3 because there are three instruments.
   - Therefore, the size of the domain for each variable is 3.

3. **Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation:**
   - Constraint C1 (exactly two observations from each scientist's list will be made) is not directly enforced by this formulation since it does not specify which specific requests (observations) are selected.
   - Constraints C2 and C3 can potentially be indirectly enforced through the structure of the problem, but they are not necessarily satisfied just because of how variables are defined.

4. **Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation:**
   - **Constraint C1:** Cannot be directly specified as a binary constraint since it requires selecting exactly two out of \(n\) requests per scientist.
   - **Constraint C2 and C3:** Can potentially be specified using binary constraints, but they require careful consideration.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Binary Constraint for C2:**
  - For each time slot (from the set of \(k\) slots), we can define a binary constraint between the variables representing the requests at that time slot. Specifically, if two different scientists have their requests scheduled to the same instrument in the same time slot, this would violate C2.
  - Example Binary Constraint: \((V_{ij}, V_{kl})\), where \(i = j\) and \(k \neq l\). This constraint ensures that no more than one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled.

- **Binary Constraint for C3:**
  - Similarly, we can define a binary constraint between the variables representing requests with the same target. If two different scientists have their requests targeting the same object in the same time slot, this would violate C3.
  - Example Binary Constraint: \((V_{ij}, V_{kl})\), where \(j = l\) and \(i \neq k\). This constraint ensures that all scheduled observations for a single time slot must have the same target.

### Counterexample for C1:
- **Counterexample:** Consider two scientists, each with three requests. If we try to enforce exactly two out of three using binary constraints alone, it's not straightforward because binary constraints can only handle pairwise relationships and cannot directly count or ensure the exact number of selected requests per scientist.
  
In conclusion, while Formulation C allows for specifying some constraints as binary constraints (C2 and C3), Constraint C1 requires a different approach to enforce exactly two observations from each scientist’s list.

If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 3. Satisfied constraints:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests, let's address each part of the question:

### 1. Value Domain for Variables
Each variable in this formulation represents a specific request from one of the \(m\) scientists to make an observation during one of the \(n\) time slots using one of the three instruments. The value domain for each variable is therefore the set of all possible observations, which can be represented as triples \((\text{target}, \text{instrument}, \text{time slot})\).

### 2. Size of the Domain for Variables
The size of the domain for each variable in this formulation is \(3kn\). This is because:
- There are \(k\) time slots.
- For each time slot, there are 3 possible instruments.
- Each scientist can make up to 2 observations per time slot (but we consider one request at a time for simplicity).

Thus, the domain size for each variable is \(3kn\).

### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied Because of the Formulation
In this formulation, no constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the way variables and their domains are defined. The constraints need to be explicitly specified as they do not naturally arise from simply defining the variables.

### 4. Whether the Constraints Can Be Specified as Binary Constraints in This Formulation

#### Constraint C1: Exactly Two Observations from Each Scientist's List Will Be Made
- **Satisfied**: Yes.
- **Explanation**: We can specify this constraint using binary constraints between pairs of variables (requests) for each scientist. Specifically, we need to ensure that exactly two out of the \(n\) requests per scientist are selected. This can be done by creating a set of binary constraints where one variable indicates whether an observation is chosen or not.

#### Constraint C2: At Most One Observation Per Instrument Per Time Slot
- **Satisfied**: Yes.
- **Explanation**: We can specify this constraint using binary constraints between variables representing the same time slot and instrument. For each combination of a time slot and an instrument, we need to ensure that at most one observation is selected. This can be done by creating a set of binary constraints where if one variable is chosen (indicating an observation), no other variable for the same time slot and instrument can be chosen.

#### Constraint C3: The Observations Scheduled for a Single Time Slot Must Have the Same Target
- **Satisfied**: No.
- **Explanation**: This constraint cannot be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation. A counterexample is when we have two scientists, each requesting an observation at the same time slot with different targets. There are no binary constraints that can enforce that all observations at a single time slot must share the same target.

In summary:
- **C1**: Can be specified using binary constraints between pairs of variables for each scientist.
- **C2**: Can be specified using binary constraints between variables representing the same time slot and instrument.
- **C3**: Cannot be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation.

Which of the constraints are necessarily satisfied because of the formulation. 4 . Whether the constraints can be specified as binary constraints in this formulation. If they can, explain how. If not, provide a counterexample. > Formulation C: The variables are the mn scientists' requests. > 4. Binary constraints?:
//// ANSWER: For Formulation C where the variables are the \(mn\) scientists' requests, let's address the question regarding binary constraints.

### 1. Value Domain for Variables
Each variable represents a scientist's request, which can be seen as an assignment of one or more observations to specific time slots and instruments. The value domain for each variable would include all possible combinations of target, instrument, and time slot that satisfy the constraints given by C2 and C3.

### 2. Size of the Domain
The size of the domain for each variable is complex because it depends on the number of valid assignments (target, instrument, time slot) that can be made while respecting constraints C2 and C3. However, we can say that the domain size is bounded by \(k \times 3\) since there are \(k\) time slots and 3 instruments.

### 3. Constraints Necessarily Satisfied
- **C1**: This constraint cannot be directly enforced through binary constraints in this formulation because it requires selecting exactly two observations for each scientist, which involves a higher-order relationship among variables.
- **C2**: This can be partially enforced by ensuring that no more than one observation per instrument per time slot is assigned. However, the exact selection of these assignments (which combination of instruments and time slots) cannot be directly specified as binary constraints in this formulation.
- **C3**: This constraint ensures that all observations at a single time slot share the same target. This can also be enforced through binary constraints by ensuring that if two variables are assigned to the same time slot, they must have the same target.

### 4. Binary Constraints?
For Formulation C, some of the constraints can indeed be specified as binary constraints, but not all:

- **C3**: Can be specified as binary constraints. Specifically, for each pair of observations \((O_1, O_2)\) assigned to the same time slot \(t\), we can add a constraint that requires \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) to have the same target.
  
- **C2**: Can be enforced through binary constraints by ensuring that no more than one observation per instrument per time slot is scheduled. For each pair of observations \((O_1, O_2)\) assigned to the same time slot \(t\), we can add a constraint that ensures at most one of them uses a specific instrument.

However, **C1** cannot be directly specified as binary constraints because it requires selecting exactly two out of \(n\) possible requests for each scientist. This involves a higher-order relationship among variables and typically would require more complex constraint satisfaction techniques such as global cardinality constraints or other higher-order constraints.

### Summary
- **Binary Constraints**: C3 can be enforced through binary constraints by ensuring that observations at the same time slot share the same target, and C2 can be enforced by limiting the number of observations per instrument per time slot.
- **C1** cannot be directly specified as a set of binary constraints in this formulation due to its higher-order nature.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of how certain constraints can be represented using binary constraints while highlighting that others require more complex formulations.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 1. Use a set of the variables above to describe the rover's state. Do not include extraneous information.
//// ANSWER: To describe the rover's state in the context of the Mars exploration problem, we can use the following variables:

- **Current Rover Location (Square on Map)**: This variable indicates where the rover currently is on the map. It helps determine the cost to traverse and the type of rock available at that location.
  
- **Current Battery Charge Level**: The current state of the battery determines how much longer the rover can operate before needing to stop for charging or returning to the lander.

- **Total Weight of Currently Collected Rocks**: This variable keeps track of the total weight of rocks collected so far, which is part of the objective function that needs to be minimized.

- **Distance to Lander**: Knowing how far the rover is from the lander helps in planning the return trip and ensuring the rover can make it back with its remaining battery charge.

- **Current Day**: This variable keeps track of the day number, helping to ensure the rover completes its mission within three days.

These variables provide a concise description of the rover's state relevant to the problem. They allow for tracking progress towards collecting rocks, managing energy resources, and planning the return journey to the lander while adhering to the constraints provided by the environment and objectives.

Specify the goal test.
//// ANSWER: Based on the problem description, the goal test for this Mars rover exploration task can be specified as follows:

**Goal Test:**
- The rover has collected one unit (rock sample) of each of the 10 types of rocks.
- The rover is back at its starting location, the lander.
- The total time elapsed since departure from the lander does not exceed three days.

To formalize this in a more structured manner:

**Goal Test:**
1. **Rover has collected all rock samples:** 
   - `types_of_rocks_collected` contains exactly 10 unique types of rocks, each type represented once.
2. **Rover is at the lander location:**
   - The rover's current location (`current_location`) matches the lander's location (`lander_location`).
3. **Time constraint satisfied:**
   - `current_day` ≤ 3 (indicating that no more than three days have passed since departure).

These conditions collectively define when the goal state is reached, ensuring both the objective of collecting all rock samples and returning to the starting point within the specified time frame are met.

This goal test ensures that the rover has successfully completed its mission by adhering strictly to the stated objectives.

Specify the actions. Indicate how they modify the state and any preconditions for being used.
//// ANSWER: For the Mars rover problem, we need to specify the actions that can be taken by the rover, along with their effects on the state and any necessary preconditions. Here are the possible actions:

1. **Drive to a neighboring square**:
   - **Effect**: Updates the current location of the rover.
   - **Precondition**: The rover must have enough battery charge to cover the distance to the target square (as indicated by the map). Additionally, the rover cannot drive into an obstacle or an area where driving is not allowed.

2. **Unfold solar collectors and charge batteries**:
   - **Effect**: Increases the current battery charge level by one unit for each hour of charging.
   - **Precondition**: The rover must be at a location with suitable conditions for unfolding the solar collectors (e.g., it's daytime, there are no obstructions).

3. **Pick up rock from current square**:
   - **Effect**: Adds the type and weight of the rock to the list of collected rocks; decreases the battery charge level by one unit.
   - **Precondition**: The rover must be at a location where a rock is present, and it has enough battery charge to perform this action.

4. **Return to lander**:
   - **Effect**: Updates the current location to the lander's location and ends the exploration plan.
   - **Precondition**: The rover must have sufficient battery charge to reach the lander (as indicated by the map). Additionally, all 10 types of rocks must be collected.

5. **Check current state variables**:
   - **Effect**: No change in state; used for decision-making purposes only.
   - **Precondition**: This action does not require any preconditions as it is a passive observation.

### Summary
- **Drive to a neighboring square**: Modifies the rover's location and potentially its battery charge level (if driving consumes energy).
- **Unfold solar collectors and charge batteries**: Increases the battery charge level.
- **Pick up rock from current square**: Adds rocks to the collection list and decreases the battery charge level.
- **Return to lander**: Ends the exploration plan, requiring a sufficient battery charge.

These actions are essential for formulating an optimal path for the rover to collect all required types of rocks while minimizing both total weight and distance traveled. The use of preconditions ensures that each action is feasible given the current state of the rover and its environment.

Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 4. Specify a function that determines the cost of each action. charge : move : pick-up-rock :
//// ANSWER: Based on the problem description, we can specify the cost functions for each action as follows:

1. **Charge**:
   - The cost to charge is determined by the time required to unfurl and use solar collectors to recharge the batteries.
   - Since one hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge, the cost function for charging can be defined as:
     \[
     \text{cost(Charge)} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]
   - This is a constant cost because it takes exactly one hour to fully recharge the batteries.

2. **Move**:
   - The cost of moving depends on the distance and time required to travel from one square to another.
   - According to the map, each square has an associated battery charge requirement (units) and time (hours) needed to traverse that location.
   - Therefore, the cost function for moving can be defined as a combination of these two factors. If \( t \) is the time required in hours to move from one square to another, then:
     \[
     \text{cost(Move)} = t \text{ hours}
     \]
   - This accounts for both the time and energy (battery charge) needed to travel.

3. **Pick-up-rock**:
   - The cost of picking up a rock is determined by the battery charge required.
   - Since it takes one unit of battery charge to pick up a rock, the cost function can be defined as:
     \[
     \text{cost(Pick-up-rock)} = 1 \text{ unit of battery charge}
     \]
   - This is also a constant cost because picking up any rock requires exactly one unit of battery charge.

To summarize:

- **Charge**: \( \text{cost(Charge)} = 1 \text{ hour} \)
- **Move**: \( \text{cost(Move)} = t \text{ hours} \) (where \( t \) is the time to move from one square to another)
- **Pick-up-rock**: \( \text{cost(Pick-up-rock)} = 1 \text{ unit of battery charge} \)

These cost functions will be used in the A* search algorithm to evaluate the total cost of each path and help find an optimal plan for the Mars rover.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 4 Search Problem formulation (23 points) Consider a Mars rover that has to drive around the surface, collect rock samples, and return to the lander. We want to construct a plan for its exploration. · It has batteries. The batteries can be charged by stopping and unfurling the solar collectors (pretend it's always daylight). One hour of solar collection results in one unit of battery charge. The batteries can hold a total of 10 units of charge. · It can drive. It has a map at 10-meter resolution indicating how many units of battery charge and how much time (in hours) will be required to reach a suitable rock in each square. · It can pick up a rock. This requires one unit of battery charge. The robot has a map at 10-meter resolution that indicates the type of rock expected in that location and the expected weight of rocks in that location. Assume only one type of rock and one size can be found in each square. The objective for the rover is to get one of each of 10 types of rocks, within three days, while minimizing a combination of their total weight and the distance traveled. You are given a tradeoff parameter α that converts units of weight to units of distance. The rover starts at the lander with a full battery and must return to the lander. Here is a list of variables that might be used to describe the rover's world: · types of rocks already collected · current rover location (square on map) · current lander location (square on map) · weight of rocks at current location (square on map) · cost to traverse the current location (square on map) · time since last charged · time since departure from lander · current day · current battery charge level · total battery capacity · distance to lander · total weight of currently collected rocks > 5. This can be treated as a path search problem. We would like to find a heuristic. Say whether each of these possible heuristics would be useful in finding the optimal path or, if not, what's wrong with them. Let l be the number of rocks already collected. H1 : The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H2 : The length of the shortest tour through the 10 -l closest locations for the missing types of rocks. H3 : The distance back to the lander
//// ANSWER: Let's analyze each heuristic in the context of the Mars rover problem:

### Heuristic Analysis

#### **H1: The sum of the distances (in the map) from the rover to the 10 - l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.**

- **Usefulness**: This heuristic is useful and can be effective.
- **Explanation**: H1 provides a good estimate of the remaining distance needed to collect all required rock samples. Since it sums up the distances to the nearest uncollected rock types, it gives an accurate idea of how much more distance needs to be traveled. It underestimates the true cost because it only considers the closest rocks and not any detours or backtracking that might be necessary.

#### **H2: The length of the shortest tour through the 10 - l closest locations for the missing types of rocks.**

- **Usefulness**: This heuristic is also useful.
- **Explanation**: H2 calculates the shortest path that visits all remaining rock types, which is a more comprehensive estimate than H1. It accounts for potential detours and backtracking needed to collect all required rocks. However, it still underestimates the true cost because it does not consider the distance back to the lander or any additional constraints like battery charge levels.

#### **H3: The distance back to the lander**

- **Usefulness**: This heuristic is less useful.
- **Explanation**: H3 only considers the distance back to the lander, which is a one-dimensional measure. It does not account for the distances to collect rocks or the total weight of rocks collected. Therefore, it significantly underestimates the true cost and would not be effective in guiding the search towards an optimal path.

### Summary

- **H1** and **H2**: Both are useful heuristics that provide good estimates by considering the remaining distance needed to collect all rock samples.
- **H3**: This heuristic is less useful because it only considers the return trip to the lander, ignoring other critical factors like distances to rocks and total weight.

In conclusion, H1 and H2 are effective heuristics for guiding the search towards an optimal path in this problem.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3.

//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the context about different search algorithms, let's analyze each tree step by step.

### G1: A → B A → D B → C B → D B → G

1. **Algorithm:** This sequence of nodes visited is not typical for either breadth-first or depth-first searches because it does not follow a strict order in terms of expanding all children at one level before moving to the next (breadth-first) or exploring as deep as possible down a path first (depth-first). Instead, it prioritizes certain nodes based on their scores.

2. **Heuristic (if any):** The sequence suggests that B is chosen over D from A because of its higher score (5 vs 3), and then C is chosen over G or D from B with the highest available score (6 > 4). This behavior aligns well with a best-first search, where nodes are selected based on their heuristic values. Given the scores, it seems that H1 might be used here because B has a higher score than D when coming from A.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:** No, this algorithm did not necessarily find the least-cost path. The choice of nodes is based on their heuristic values rather than actual link costs. For instance, the path chosen goes through B and C with scores 5 and 6 respectively, which might be higher in cost compared to other paths that could have been explored but were not due to the heuristic guiding the search.

### Summary for G1:
1. Algorithm: Best-first (greedy) search.
2. Heuristic used: H1.
3. Did it find least-cost path? No, because the choice was based on heuristic values rather than actual link costs.

This analysis can be applied similarly to other trees if provided with their respective node sequences and scores.

//// ANSWER: Based on the provided information and the structure of the search trees, let's analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used.

### Tree G1:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first (greedy) search.
  - The nodes are expanded based on their heuristic values. Node A is expanded first with a lower heuristic value (2), then B with a higher value (5), and so forth, following the greedy approach of always expanding the node with the lowest heuristic value.

- **Heuristic Used:** H1: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 6 \), \( h(C) = 4 \), \( h(D) = 3 \).

- **Did it find least-cost path?** No.
  - The path found is A → B → C → G, which has a cost of 12. However, the optimal path (A → D → G) would have a cost of 6.

### Tree G2:
- **Algorithm:** Best-first (greedy) search.
  - Similar to G1, nodes are expanded based on their heuristic values. Node A is expanded first with a higher heuristic value (6), then D with a lower value (4).

- **Heuristic Used:** H2: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 3 \), \( h(C) = 0 \), \( h(D) = 2 \).

- **Did it find least-cost path?** No.
  - The path found is A → D → C → G, which has a cost of 9. However, the optimal path (A → D → G) would have a cost of 6.

### Summary:
1. **Tree G1:**
   - Algorithm: Best-first (greedy) search.
   - Heuristic Used: H1.
   - Did it find least-cost path? No, because the path found is not optimal.

2. **Tree G2:**
   - Algorithm: Best-first (greedy) search.
   - Heuristic Used: H2.
   - Did it find least-cost path? No, because the path found is not optimal.

If not, why
//// ANSWER: Based on the provided context and the search traces for trees G1-G7, let's analyze tree G3 specifically:

### Tree G3 Analysis

**Nodes Visited:**
- A (7) → B
- A (6) → D
- D (8) → C
- D (6) → G

Given that children are visited in alphabetical order and the numbers next to nodes indicate the score used by the algorithm, we can deduce the following:

1. **Algorithm: Best-first (greedy) search**
   - In best-first search, the node with the lowest heuristic value is expanded first. Here, A has a lower score (7) compared to D (6), and it expands B before expanding D. This suggests that the algorithm used here prioritizes nodes based on their scores rather than depth or breadth.

2. **Heuristic Used:**
   - Since this is best-first search, we need to determine which heuristic was used.
   - Given the options:
     - **H1**: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 6 \), \( h(C) = 4 \), \( h(D) = 3 \)
     - **H2**: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 3 \), \( h(C) = 0 \), \( h(D) = 2 \)

   - The scores in G3 suggest that the heuristic used is H1 because:
     - A (7) → B (6): This aligns with \( h(A) = 3 \) and \( h(B) = 6 \).
     - D (8) → C (4): This aligns with \( h(D) = 3 \) and \( h(C) = 4 \).

   Therefore, the heuristic used is H1.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:**
   - The path found by this algorithm is A → B → C → G.
   - To determine if this is optimal, we need to compare the total cost of this path with other possible paths in the graph.
   - Given that the scores are heuristic values and do not directly represent link costs, we cannot definitively say whether it's an optimal path without knowing the actual link costs. However, since best-first search does not guarantee optimality (it only guarantees finding a solution if one exists), and given the nature of this problem where nodes are expanded based on their heuristic value rather than cost, it is likely that this path is not necessarily the least-cost path.

   **Conclusion:**
   - The algorithm used for G3 is best-first search with heuristic H1.
   - It did not find the least-cost path because best-first search does not guarantee optimality. The specific scores and expansion order suggest a prioritization based on heuristic values rather than actual link costs, making it possible that a different sequence of expansions could yield a lower total cost path.

### Summary for G3:
1. **Algorithm:** Best-first (greedy) search
2. **Heuristic Used:** H1: \( h(A)=3 \), \( h(B)=6 \), \( h(C)=4 \), \( h(D)=3 \)
3. **Did it find least-cost path?** No, because best-first search does not guarantee optimality in terms of the sum of link costs.

If not, why
//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the context given about Best-First Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search, let's analyze each tree:

### G4: A (3) → B A (2) → D D (0) → C C → G

1. **Algorithm:** This search trace shows a preference for nodes with lower scores early on, but it also extends to explore further nodes when necessary. The node "D" is expanded before "B", and then the algorithm seems to backtrack or continue exploring other paths. Given that it prioritizes lower scores initially and explores further when needed, this suggests **Best-First Search** (Greedy Best-First Search).

2. **Heuristic (if any):**
   - The heuristic used here is likely **H1**: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 6 \), \( h(C) = 4 \), \( h(D) = 3 \).
   - This is because the algorithm chooses nodes with lower heuristic values first, and "D" (with a heuristic value of 3) is expanded before "B" (with a heuristic value of 6).

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:**
   - The search did not necessarily find the optimal path based on the provided information.
   - The algorithm chose to expand node "D" first instead of "B", which might have led to an alternative path that could be shorter in terms of actual link costs. However, without knowing the exact cost values for each edge, we cannot definitively say if this was suboptimal.

### Summary:
1. **Algorithm:** Best-First Search (Greedy)
2. **Heuristic (if any):** H1
3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why:**
   - No, the search did not necessarily find the least-cost path because it prioritized nodes based on heuristic values rather than actual link costs. The choice to expand "D" first might have led to a suboptimal path if there was a cheaper route through "B".

If not, why?
//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the context about different search algorithms, let's analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used.

### Tree G5: A → B A → D B → C B → D B → G C → G

1. **Algorithm:** Best-first (greedy) search.
   - In best-first search, we always expand the node with the lowest heuristic value first. Here, starting from A, the next nodes are expanded in alphabetical order (B and D), but since B has a lower heuristic value (6 compared to 3 for D), it is chosen first.

2. **Heuristic (if any):** H1: \( h(A) = 3 \), \( h(B) = 6 \), \( h(C) = 4 \), \( h(D) = 3 \).
   - The heuristic values are used to determine the order in which nodes are expanded, with B being chosen over D due to its lower heuristic value.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No, it did not find the least-cost path.
   - The optimal path (measured by sum of link costs) would be A → B → G with a total cost of 6 + 1 = 7. However, the algorithm chose to go from B to C and D instead of directly going to G from B, resulting in an additional step and thus a higher total cost.

### Summary for Tree G5:
1. Algorithm: Best-first (greedy) search.
2. Heuristic: H1.
3. Did it find least-cost path? No. The algorithm chose A → B → C/G instead of the optimal path A → B → G, leading to a higher total cost due to additional steps.

### G1: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G
1. **Algorithm:** Depth First Search (DFS)

   - There are no heuristic values provided that would guide the search in a different order than alphabetical depth-first expansion.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**

   - The node with the lowest heuristic is expanded first, which matches the greedy nature of Best-First Search using H1.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**

1. **Algorithm:** Best-First Search (Greedy)
   - The nodes are expanded based on the heuristic values, which suggests a greedy approach.
   - B has a lower heuristic value of 7 compared to D with 8.

2. **Heuristic (if any):** H1: Heuristic 1 = { h(A)=3, h(B)=6, h(C)=4, h(D)=3 }
   - The node with the lowest heuristic is expanded first, which matches the greedy nature of Best-First Search using H1.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - Yes, because this path (A → B → C → G) has a cost of 2 + 7 + 4 = 13, and there are no other paths shown that have a lower total cost.

### G6: A (3) → D A (2) → B B (7) → C B (8) → G
1. **Algorithm:** Best-First Search (Greedy)
   - The nodes are expanded based on the heuristic values, which suggests a greedy approach.
   - A has a lower heuristic value of 3 compared to B with 6.

2. **Heuristic (if any):** H2: Heuristic 2 = { h(A)=3, h(B)=3, h(C)=0, h(D)=2 }
   - The node with the lowest heuristic is expanded first, which matches the greedy nature of Best-First Search using H2.

3. **Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?**
   - No, because while this approach might find a good path quickly, it does not guarantee optimality.
   - The path found (A → D → C → G) is 3 + 6 + 4 = 13, but other paths may be shorter.

### Summary
- **G2 and G3** use H1 for Best-First Search.
- **G4 and G6** use H2 for Best-First Search.
- **G5** finds the least-cost path using Best-First Search with H1. 

These analyses show that while Best-First Search can find good paths quickly, it does not always guarantee finding the shortest path based on link costs. DFS is used in G1 and does not use any heuristic values. The other searches are guided by heuristics but do not necessarily find optimal solutions.

QUESTION: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 5 Search traces (21 points) Consider the graph shown in the figure below. We can search it with a variety of different algorithms, resulting in different search trees. Each of the trees (labeled G1-G7) was generated by searching this graph, but with a different algorithm. Assume that children of a node are visited in alphabetical order. Each tree shows all the nodes that have been visited. Numbers next to nodes indicate the relevant 'score' used by the algorithm for those nodes. G: A (1) → B A (3) → D A (2) → B B (5) → C B (6) → G B (4) → D D (1) → C D (3) → G C (1) → G For each tree, indicate whether it was generated with 1. Depth first search 2. Breadth first search 3. Uniform cost search 4. A* search 5. Best-first (greedy) search In all cases a strict expanded list was used. Furthermore, if you choose an algorithm that uses a heuristic function, say whether we used H1 :heuristic 1 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=6 ,h ( C )=4 ,h ( D )=3 } H2 :heuristic 2 = { h ( A )=3 ,h ( B )=3 ,h ( C )=0 ,h ( D )=2 } Also, for all algorithms, say whether the result was an optimal path (measured by sum of link costs), and if not, why not. Be specific. Write your answers in the space provided below (not on the figure). > G7: A (1) → B A (3) → D B (6) → C B (5) → D B (7) → G D (6) → C D (8) → G D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G 1. Algorithm: 2. Heuristic (if any): 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
//// ANSWER: Based on the provided search traces and the context about different search algorithms, we can analyze each tree to determine which algorithm was used.

### G7: A (1) → B A (3) → D B (6) → C B (5) → D B (7) → G D (6) → C D (8) → G D (4) → C D (6) → G C (5) → G

#### 1. Algorithm:
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: This algorithm explores as far down a branch as it can before backtracking.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Uniform Cost Search**: This algorithm expands the node with the lowest path cost first.
- **A* Search**: This algorithm uses a heuristic function combined with the actual cost of reaching a node.
- **Best-First (Greedy) Search**: This algorithm always expands the least-costly node according to the heuristic.

Given that G7 visits nodes in an order that does not follow a strict level-by-level or depth-first exploration, and considering the scores next to each node, it appears that this tree was generated by **Best-First (Greedy) Search**. The algorithm prioritizes nodes based on their heuristic values, which are represented as scores here.

#### 2. Heuristic (if any):
- **Heuristic**: Yes.
- **Heuristic Used**: H1: \( h(A)=3 \), \( h(B)=6 \), \( h(C)=4 \), \( h(D)=3 \)
- The heuristic values used are the scores next to each node, which guide the selection of nodes. For example, starting from A, B is chosen over D because it has a higher score (6 vs 3).

#### 3. Did it find least-cost path? If not, why?
- **Result**: No.
- **Reason**: The algorithm used here is Best-First Search with the given heuristic H1. While this approach can be effective in finding good solutions quickly, it does not guarantee an optimal solution (least-cost path). In G7, although B and D are expanded before C, the path chosen (B → C) has a higher total cost compared to other possible paths that might have been explored if the algorithm were more exhaustive.

To summarize:
1. **Algorithm**: Best-First (Greedy) Search
2. **Heuristic Used**: H1: \( h(A)=3 \), \( h(B)=6 \), \( h(C)=4 \), \( h(D)=3 \)
3. **Did it find least-cost path? No, because the algorithm is not guaranteed to explore all possible paths and may prioritize nodes based on heuristic values rather than actual costs.
