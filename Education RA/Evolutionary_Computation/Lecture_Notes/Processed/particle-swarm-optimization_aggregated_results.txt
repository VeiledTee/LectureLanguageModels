=== plot_best_vs_current_position.png ===
The image is a graph with a grid layout, displaying two points connected by a blue arrow. 

- The x-axis and y-axis both range from 0 to 4, with grid lines marking each integer value.
- The point labeled "Best Known" is marked in red and located at the coordinates (2, 1).
- The point labeled "Current" is marked in green and located at the coordinates (3, 4).
- A blue arrow connects the "Best Known" point to the "Current" point, indicating a direction from the former to the latter.
- The labels "Best Known" and "Current" are positioned near their respective points, with "Best Known" in red and "Current" in green.

The image is a contour plot with a color gradient representing different values on a two-dimensional plane. Here's a detailed description:

- **Axes**: The plot has two axes labeled "x" and "y", each ranging from -10 to 10.
- **Contour Lines**: There are several contour lines, which are elliptical in shape, centered around the origin (0, 0). These lines represent different levels of the function being plotted.
- **Color Gradient**: The background color transitions smoothly from dark purple at the lower values to bright yellow at the higher values. This gradient represents the magnitude of the function.
- **Color Bar**: On the right side of the plot, there is a vertical color bar indicating the scale of values from \(10^{-3}\) to \(10^{2}\). The color bar shows the correspondence between the colors and the numerical values.
- **Contour Levels**: The contour lines are drawn at different levels, with the innermost contours being closer together and indicating higher values.
- **Overall Appearance**: The plot has a smooth gradient, with the highest values near the center and decreasing outward.

This contour plot is likely used to visualize a mathematical function or data distribution over a specified range.

=== ackley_function.png ===
The image is a 3D plot of the Ackley function, a common test function used in optimization problems. The plot is displayed on a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with axes labeled \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(f(x_1, x_2)\).

- **Axes**:
  - The \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) axes range from -40 to 40.
  - The \(f(x_1, x_2)\) axis ranges from 0 to 25.

- **Surface**:
  - The surface is a mesh grid with a wavy pattern, characterized by a central depression and multiple peaks and valleys.
  - The central part of the surface dips downwards, forming a funnel-like shape.
  - The color gradient on the surface ranges from blue at the lowest point to red at the peaks, indicating changes in function value.

- **Title**:
  - The plot is titled "Ackley Function" at the top.

- **Grid**:
  - The plot includes a dotted grid to help visualize the surface contours and the relationship between the axes.

This visualization helps in understanding the complex landscape of the Ackley function, which is often used to test optimization algorithms due to its many local minima.

=== plot_position_update.png ===
The image is a graph with a black background and white grid lines, showing a vector addition scenario. It includes three vectors represented by arrows, each labeled with different colors and text.

1. **Axes**: 
   - The graph has an x-axis and a y-axis, both marked with numerical increments from -1 to 3.

2. **Vectors**:
   - **Current Position**: A green arrow starting from the origin (0,0) and pointing to the coordinates (3,2). It is labeled "Current Position" in green text.
   - **Velocity**: A blue arrow starting from the origin (0,0) and pointing to the coordinates (-1,-1). It is labeled "Velocity" in blue text.
   - **New Position**: A red dashed arrow starting from the tip of the "Velocity" vector at (-1,-1) and pointing to the coordinates (3,2), aligning with the tip of the "Current Position" vector. It is labeled "New Position" in red text.

3. **Overall Composition**:
   - The vectors illustrate a vector addition where the "Current Position" and "Velocity" vectors combine to form the "New Position" vector.
   - The grid provides a clear reference for the vector directions and magnitudes.

This image effectively demonstrates the concept of vector addition in a two-dimensional space.
