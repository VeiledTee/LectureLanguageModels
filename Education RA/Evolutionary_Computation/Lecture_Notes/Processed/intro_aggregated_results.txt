The image is a flowchart illustrating a process with five main components. The components are represented as rectangular boxes connected by arrows, indicating the flow of the process.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Located at the top of the chart.
   - Represented by a light blue rectangle.
   - An arrow points downward from this box to the next component.

2. **Evaluation**:
   - Positioned below "Initialization."
   - Represented by a light green rectangle.
   - Receives an arrow from "Initialization."
   - Two arrows extend from this box: one pointing right towards "Selection" and another looping back from "Variation."

3. **Selection**:
   - Located to the right of "Evaluation."
   - Represented by a light green rectangle.
   - An arrow points from "Evaluation" to this box.
   - An arrow extends from this box to "Variation."

4. **Variation**:
   - Positioned above "Selection."
   - Represented by a light green rectangle.
   - Receives an arrow from "Selection."
   - An arrow loops back from this box to "Evaluation."

5. **Termination**:
   - Located at the bottom of the chart.
   - Represented by a light blue rectangle.
   - Receives an arrow from "Evaluation."

The arrows are color-coded: blue for the main flow from "Initialization" to "Termination," and green for the iterative loop between "Evaluation," "Selection," and "Variation." This flowchart likely represents a cyclical process with an evaluation and selection loop before reaching termination.
