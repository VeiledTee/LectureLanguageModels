=== comparing_distributions.png ===
The image is a bar chart titled "Comparison of Distributions." It displays two overlapping histograms representing the frequency of fitness values for two different crossover rates, 70% and 20%.

- **X-axis:** Labeled "Fitness Value," ranging from 0 to 14.
- **Y-axis:** Labeled "Frequency," ranging from 0 to 50.

- **Legend:**
  - Blue bars represent "Crossover of 70%."
  - Orange bars represent "Crossover of 20%."

- **Distribution Details:**
  - The orange bars (Crossover of 20%) have a higher frequency at lower fitness values, peaking at around 0 with a frequency of about 50.
  - The blue bars (Crossover of 70%) are more spread out, with frequencies peaking around fitness values of 2 to 4, with lower frequencies compared to the orange bars.

The chart effectively compares how different crossover rates affect the distribution of fitness values.

=== distribution_of_results_nqueens.png ===
The image is a histogram titled "Distribution of Results." It displays the frequency of fitness values on the x-axis, labeled "Fitness Value," and the frequency on the y-axis, labeled "Frequency."

- The x-axis ranges from 0 to 10, with tick marks at intervals of 2.
- The y-axis ranges from 0 to 50, with tick marks at intervals of 10.
- The histogram consists of four bars:
  - The first bar, representing the range from 0 to 1, has a frequency of about 12.
  - The second bar, representing the range from 1 to 2, has the highest frequency, reaching 50.
  - The third bar, representing the range from 2 to 3, has a frequency of about 30.
  - The fourth bar, representing the range from 3 to 4, has a frequency of about 5.
- There are no bars beyond the value of 4 on the x-axis, indicating that all data falls within the 0 to 4 range.

The overall distribution shows a skew towards lower fitness values, with the majority of data concentrated between 1 and 2.

=== fitness_over_time.png ===
The image is a line graph titled "Fitness Over Time." It displays two lines representing fitness metrics over multiple generations.

- **X-axis**: Labeled "Generation," ranging from 0 to 25.
- **Y-axis**: Labeled "Fitness," ranging from 600 to 1100.

There are two lines:

1. **Blue Line (Best Fitness)**:
   - Starts around a fitness level of 800 at generation 0.
   - Shows a gradual increase with some plateaus, reaching around 1000 by generation 25.
   - Notable increase between generations 20 and 25.

2. **Orange Line (Average Fitness)**:
   - Begins lower than the blue line, around 600 at generation 0.
   - Exhibits more fluctuations compared to the blue line.
   - Peaks and troughs are visible, with a general upward trend, reaching above 900 by generation 25.

- **Legend**: Located in the top left corner, indicating the blue line as "Best Fitness" and the orange line as "Average Fitness."

The graph illustrates the progression of fitness metrics over time, highlighting improvements and variations in both best and average fitness levels.

=== fitness_over_time_nqueens.png ===
The image is a line graph titled "Fitness Over Time." It displays two lines representing "Best Fitness" and "Average Fitness" over a series of generations.

- **Axes**: 
  - The x-axis is labeled "Generation" and ranges from 0 to 250.
  - The y-axis is labeled "Fitness" and ranges from 0 to 12.

- **Lines**:
  - The blue line represents "Best Fitness." It starts at a fitness level of around 6, fluctuates, and generally trends downward, reaching 0 by around generation 150, where it remains constant.
  - The orange line represents "Average Fitness." It begins at a fitness level of around 12, showing a more gradual decline with fluctuations, and also reaches 0 by around generation 150, staying flat thereafter.

- **Legend**: 
  - Located in the upper right corner, indicating the blue line as "Best Fitness" and the orange line as "Average Fitness."

The graph shows a general trend of decreasing fitness over time, with both best and average fitness converging to zero by generation 150.

=== swap_mutation.png ===
The image consists of two sequences of numbers, each contained within a row of individual boxes. 

- The first sequence on the left shows the numbers 1 through 9 in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The numbers 2 and 5 are highlighted with a gray background.

- An arrow pointing to the right separates the two sequences, indicating a transformation or rearrangement.

- The second sequence on the right displays the numbers in a different order: 1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9. In this sequence, the numbers 5 and 2 are highlighted with a gray background.

The image illustrates a specific rearrangement of the numbers, with emphasis on the highlighted numbers that have changed positions.

=== 8_queens_conflicts.png ===
The image is a chessboard with an 8x8 grid, labeled with coordinates. The rows are numbered 0 to 7 from bottom to top, and the columns are numbered 0 to 7 from left to right. The squares are colored in an alternating light and dark pattern, typical of a chessboard.

There are six queens placed on the board, each represented by a white queen icon:

1. A queen is on square (0, 6).
2. A queen is on square (1, 7).
3. A queen is on square (2, 4).
4. A queen is on square (3, 3).
5. A queen is on square (4, 2).
6. A queen is on square (5, 0).

This configuration is part of a chess puzzle or problem, possibly related to the "N-Queens" problem, where the goal is to place queens on the board so that no two queens threaten each other.
