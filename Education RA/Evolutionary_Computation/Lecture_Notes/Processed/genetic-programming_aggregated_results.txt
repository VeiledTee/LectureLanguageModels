=== regression_nonlinear_data_linear_model.png ===
The image is a scatter plot with a line graph, titled "Some Nonlinear Function's Data." It displays data points and a linear model on a Cartesian plane.

- **Axes**: 
  - The x-axis is labeled "x" and ranges from approximately -50 to 50.
  - The y-axis is labeled "f(x)" and ranges from 0 to 3000.

- **Data Points**: 
  - Blue dots represent the observations. These points form a parabolic shape, indicating a nonlinear relationship. The data points are dense near the vertex of the parabola, which is located around x = 0 and y = 500, and they spread out as they move away from the vertex.

- **Linear Model**: 
  - A red line represents the linear model. It has a slight negative slope and does not fit the data points well, as it cuts across the middle of the parabolic distribution.

- **Legend**: 
  - The legend is located in the upper right corner of the plot. It includes:
    - A red line labeled "Linear Model."
    - A blue dot labeled "Observation."

The plot visually demonstrates the mismatch between the linear model and the nonlinear data distribution.

The image is a plot titled "Some Nonlinear Function's Data." It displays a graph with the x-axis labeled "x" and the y-axis labeled "f(x)." The plot shows a nonlinear curve and data points:

1. **Curve**: A smooth red line represents the "Nonlinear Model." It forms a U-shaped curve, indicating a parabolic or quadratic relationship. The curve starts high on the left, dips to a minimum near the center, and rises again on the right.

2. **Data Points**: Blue dots labeled "Observation" are scattered along the red curve. These dots closely follow the shape of the curve, suggesting that the observations align well with the model.

3. **Axes**: 
   - The x-axis ranges from approximately -50 to 50.
   - The y-axis ranges from 0 to 3000.

4. **Legend**: Located in the bottom left corner, it distinguishes between the "Nonlinear Model" (red line) and "Observation" (blue dots).

The graph effectively illustrates the relationship between the model and observed data, showing a good fit between the two.

The image depicts a binary tree structure used for summation. It consists of three levels:

1. **Top Level (Root Node):**
   - Contains a single node with a plus sign ("+") indicating an addition operation.

2. **Middle Level:**
   - Two nodes, each containing a plus sign ("+"). These nodes are connected to the root node by lines.

3. **Bottom Level (Leaf Nodes):**
   - Four nodes, each containing the number "1". These nodes are connected to the middle-level nodes by lines.
   - The left middle node connects to two "1" nodes.
   - The right middle node connects to two "1" nodes.

The nodes with plus signs are white, while the nodes with the number "1" are gray. The structure represents a hierarchical addition of numbers, starting from the bottom level and aggregating upwards.

The image is a binary expression tree used to represent a mathematical expression. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Root Node**:
   - The root node is a plus sign (`+`), indicating an addition operation.

2. **Left Subtree**:
   - The left child of the root is a minus sign (`-`), indicating a subtraction operation.
   - This node has two children:
     - Left child: A leaf node with the value `1.2`.
     - Right child: A leaf node with the variable `x`.

3. **Right Subtree**:
   - The right child of the root is a `sin` function node.
   - This node has one child:
     - A multiplication sign (`*`), indicating a multiplication operation.
     - This multiplication node has two children:
       - Left child: Another multiplication sign (`*`).
         - This node has two children:
           - Left child: A minus sign (`-`).
             - This node has two children:
               - Left child: A leaf node with the value `1.2`.
               - Right child: A leaf node with the variable `x`.
           - Right child: A leaf node with the variable `y`.
       - Right child: An exponential function node (`e^`).
         - This node has one child:
           - A leaf node with the variable `x`.

4. **Node Colors**:
   - The nodes containing operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `sin`, `e^`) are in light gray.
   - The leaf nodes containing values and variables (`1.2`, `x`, `y`) are in dark gray.

The tree structure visually represents the hierarchical order of operations in the expression.

The image depicts a decision tree diagram with logical operations. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Root Node**:
   - The top node is labeled "and" and is connected to two sub-nodes.

2. **Left Subtree**:
   - The left child of the "and" node is a node labeled ">".
   - This ">" node has two children:
     - The left child is labeled "size" and is filled with a gray color.
     - The right child is labeled "4" and is also filled with a gray color.

3. **Right Subtree**:
   - The right child of the "and" node is a node labeled "or".
   - The "or" node has two children, both labeled "==":
     - The left "==" node has two children:
       - The left child is labeled "shape" and filled with gray.
       - The right child is labeled "3" and filled with gray.
     - The right "==" node also has two children:
       - The left child is labeled "shape" and filled with gray.
       - The right child is labeled "5" and filled with gray.

The tree structure represents a logical expression where the root "and" node combines the results of the left and right subtrees. The left subtree checks if "size" is greater than 4, while the right subtree checks if "shape" equals 3 or 5.

The image is a diagram representing a logical structure, likely part of a decision tree or flowchart. It consists of three main components:

1. **Top Node**: 
   - A circle labeled "or" at the top. This node is connected to two elements below it, indicating a logical OR operation.

2. **Right Node**:
   - A smaller circle labeled "True" on the right side. It is connected to the "or" node with a straight line.

3. **Left Node**:
   - A large triangle labeled "Sub-Tree" on the left side. It is also connected to the "or" node with a straight line. The triangle is filled with a light gray color.

The diagram uses black lines to connect the nodes, and the text is in a bold, black font. The overall layout suggests a branching decision process where the "or" node evaluates the "True" condition or the "Sub-Tree" condition.
