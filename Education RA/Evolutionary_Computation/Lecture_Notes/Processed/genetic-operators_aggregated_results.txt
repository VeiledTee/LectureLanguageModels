The image is a diagram of a rectangular pulse signal plotted on a graph. The horizontal axis is labeled "Time (t)" and the vertical axis is labeled "Amplitude (A)." 

Key features of the diagram include:

1. **Pulse Shape**: The pulse is rectangular, with a flat top and two vertical edges. It starts at a lower amplitude, jumps to a higher amplitude, maintains that level, and then drops back to the lower amplitude.

2. **Horizontal Lines**: 
   - The pulse begins with a horizontal line at the bottom, representing the initial amplitude level.
   - It then rises vertically to a higher amplitude level, where it remains flat for a period before dropping back down vertically to the initial level.

3. **Vertical Lines**: 
   - Two vertical dashed lines indicate the rise and fall of the pulse. These lines are labeled with "t1" and "t2" at the bottom, marking the start and end of the pulse duration.

4. **Points**: 
   - There are four marked points on the diagram, two at the bottom amplitude level and two at the top. The points at the top are filled blue circles, while those at the bottom are white circles with blue outlines.

5. **Labels**: 
   - The pulse duration is labeled as "τ" (tau) between the two vertical dashed lines.
   - The amplitude level is labeled as "A" at the top of the pulse.

Overall, the diagram represents a typical rectangular pulse signal, showing its amplitude and duration over time.
