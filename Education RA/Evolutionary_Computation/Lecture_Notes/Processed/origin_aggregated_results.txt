The image is a fractal pattern known as the Sierpinski triangle. It is an equilateral triangle subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. The pattern is characterized by a large triangle at the top, which contains smaller triangles within it, creating a repeating pattern of triangular voids.

- The overall shape is a large equilateral triangle.
- Within this large triangle, there are smaller triangles arranged in a symmetrical pattern.
- Each side of the large triangle is subdivided into smaller triangles, forming a series of progressively smaller triangles.
- The pattern continues down to a fine level of detail, with each smaller triangle containing even smaller triangles within it.
- The image is black and white, with the triangles outlined in black and the voids left white.
- At the bottom of the image, there is a label that reads "200 steps," indicating the level of iteration or recursion used to generate the fractal pattern.

The Sierpinski triangle is a classic example of a self-similar fractal, where each part resembles the whole.

=== rule_30_shell.png ===
The image shows a cone snail resting on a sandy substrate. The shell is elongated and conical, featuring a complex and intricate pattern. The pattern consists of a network of brown, zigzagging lines and shapes resembling a mosaic or lattice, set against a creamy white background. The shell's surface appears smooth and glossy, reflecting light. The sand beneath the snail is composed of fine grains, with a few small pebbles scattered throughout. The overall appearance of the shell is striking and visually appealing due to its detailed and symmetrical design.

=== turtles_turtles.png ===
The image depicts three turtles stacked on top of each other on a grassy surface. The bottom turtle is the largest, with a dark, shiny shell. On top of it is a medium-sized turtle with a slightly lighter shell. The smallest turtle is on the very top, with a light brown shell and a more pronounced pattern. The turtles are positioned in such a way that they appear to be aligned vertically, with each turtle facing forward. The grass around them is green and appears to be in a natural outdoor setting. The lighting suggests it is a sunny day, as the shells of the turtles are reflecting light.

=== phylogenetic_tree.png ===
The image is a phylogenetic tree diagram depicting the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Each domain is represented in a distinct color and contains various branches representing different groups within each domain.

**Bacteria (Blue):**
- The branches include:
  - Spirochetes
  - Gram-positives
  - Proteobacteria
  - Cyanobacteria
  - Planctomycetes
  - Bacteroides Cytophaga
  - Thermotoga
  - Aquifex
  - Chloroflexi

**Archaea (Red):**
- The branches include:
  - Methanosarcina
  - Methanobacterium
  - Methanococcus
  - Thermococcus celer
  - Thermoproteus
  - Pyrodicticum
  - Haloarchaea

**Eukaryota (Brown):**
- The branches include:
  - Entamoebae
  - Slime molds
  - Animals
  - Fungi
  - Plants
  - Ciliates
  - Flagellates
  - Trichomonads
  - Microsporidia
  - Diplomonads

The tree structure visually represents the evolutionary relationships among these groups, with each branch indicating a divergence from a common ancestor. The diagram is labeled with the domain names at the top in their respective colors.
