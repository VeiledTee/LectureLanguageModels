The image depicts a circular arrangement of numbered segments, resembling a ring or wheel. The circle is divided into 24 equal sections, each labeled with a number from 1 to 24 in a clockwise direction. The numbers are placed inside gray segments, bordered by a thick black outline.

Above the circle, there are two labels with arrows pointing in a clockwise direction. The first label reads "index = 1," and the second label reads "d = 3." These labels suggest a starting point and a step size or increment for moving around the circle.

The overall design appears to illustrate a concept related to circular indexing or rotation, possibly for educational or illustrative purposes.

The image is a diagram consisting of three circles labeled P1, P2, and P3, arranged in a triangular formation. Each circle is filled with a light gray color and outlined in black.

- **P1** is positioned at the top left.
- **P2** is at the top right.
- **P3** is at the bottom center.

Arrows indicate the direction of interactions or migrations between these points:

- There is a bidirectional arrow between P1 and P2 labeled "Migrations," indicating a two-way interaction.
- A unidirectional arrow points from P1 to P3.
- Another unidirectional arrow points from P2 to P3.

The diagram suggests a flow or exchange system among the three points, with P1 and P2 having a reciprocal relationship, while both P1 and P2 have a direct relationship with P3.

=== roulette_wheel_selection.png ===
The image features a pie chart and a table, illustrating a roulette wheel selection process used in genetic algorithms.

**Pie Chart:**
- The chart is divided into six colored segments, each representing a chromosome labeled A to F.
- Segment sizes correspond to the fitness values of the chromosomes.
- Colors and labels:
  - A: Light blue, largest segment.
  - B: Dark blue.
  - C: Yellow.
  - D: Orange.
  - E: Gray.
  - F: Green, smallest segment.
- A black arrow labeled "Fixed Point" points to the boundary between segments B and C.
- A handwritten arrow labeled "Spin the roulette wheel" indicates the direction of selection.

**Table:**
- Two columns: "Chromosome" and "Fitness Value."
- Rows list chromosomes A to F with corresponding fitness values:
  - A: 8.2
  - B: 3.2
  - C: 1.4
  - D: 1.2
  - E: 4.2
  - F: 0.3

**Text:**
- "Choose D as the parent" is written in red below the pie chart, indicating chromosome D is selected as the parent.

The image demonstrates how the roulette wheel selection method is used to choose a chromosome based on fitness values.

=== stochastic_universal_sampling_selection.png ===
The image features a pie chart and a table, likely illustrating a genetic algorithm or selection process.

**Pie Chart:**
- The chart is divided into six segments, each representing a chromosome labeled A through F.
- Segment sizes vary, corresponding to their fitness values.
- Colors for each segment are as follows:
  - A: Blue
  - B: Orange
  - C: Gray
  - D: Yellow
  - E: Dark Blue
  - F: Green
- Two black arrows labeled "Fixed Point" are positioned on opposite sides of the pie chart.
- An arrow labeled "Spin" indicates a clockwise direction around the chart.

**Table:**
- The table is located to the right of the pie chart.
- It has two columns: "Chromosome" and "Fitness Value."
- Chromosome labels (A to F) are listed with corresponding fitness values:
  - A: 8.2
  - B: 3.2
  - C: 1.4
  - D: 1.2
  - E: 4.2
  - F: 0.3

The chart and table together illustrate the distribution of fitness values among different chromosomes, with the pie chart visually representing the proportion of each chromosome based on its fitness value.

=== tournament_selection.png ===
The image illustrates a process for selecting a parent chromosome in a genetic algorithm using a tournament selection method. It consists of a table and a flow diagram:

1. **Table on the Left:**
   - The table has two columns: "Fitness Value" and "Chromosome."
   - The "Fitness Value" column contains values ranging from 0 to 9.
   - The "Chromosome" column lists letters from A to I, each corresponding to a fitness value.

2. **Selection Process:**
   - Three chromosomes are selected at random from the list: A, E, and T.
   - These selections are highlighted with red boxes around the corresponding rows in the table.
   - Red arrows point from these selected chromosomes to separate boxes on the right.

3. **Flow Diagram on the Right:**
   - Each selected chromosome (A, E, T) is placed in its own box.
   - An arrow points from these boxes to a final box labeled "Pick the best as parent."
   - The chromosome with the highest fitness value among the selected ones, A, is chosen as the parent.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The process is labeled with "Select K chromosomes at random" and "Pick the best as parent" to describe the steps.

This image effectively demonstrates the tournament selection method in genetic algorithms, highlighting the random selection and subsequent choice of the chromosome with the highest fitness value.
