=== random_variables_together.png ===
The image consists of a 2x2 grid layout with two 3D box illustrations on the left and three histograms on the right.

1. **Top Left:**
   - A 3D box is depicted with a dark gray color. The box is outlined in black, giving it a solid appearance.

2. **Top Right:**
   - A histogram with a blue color. The x-axis ranges from 5 to 22.5, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 10. The distribution is roughly bell-shaped, peaking around the 17.5 mark.

3. **Bottom Left:**
   - Another 3D box is shown, this time in a lighter gray shade. It also has a black outline but appears slightly thicker than the top left box.

4. **Bottom Right:**
   - Two overlapping histograms are displayed. The first histogram is orange, and the second is blue. The x-axis ranges from 5 to 22.5, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 10. The orange histogram has a broader distribution, while the blue histogram is more concentrated around the 17.5 mark. The overlapping area is shown in a darker shade due to the combination of colors.

The image appears to compare different data distributions and their visual representations alongside 3D box illustrations.

=== chance_average_group_differences_with_observation.png ===
The image is a histogram depicting the distribution of average group differences in recovery time. The x-axis is labeled "Average Group Differences," ranging from approximately -2 to 2. The y-axis is labeled "Count," with values ranging from 0 to 17500.

The histogram bars are blue, showing a roughly normal distribution centered around 0. The tallest bars are near the center, indicating that most of the average group differences are around zero.

A vertical red line is drawn at approximately -1.8 on the x-axis, representing the "Observed Difference." A legend in the top right corner identifies this line, labeled in red as "Observed Difference."

The title of the plot is "Chance Average Group Differences in Recovery Time," indicating that the histogram represents the distribution of differences that could occur by chance.

=== chance_average_group_differences.png ===
The image is a histogram chart titled "Chance Average Group Differences in Recovery Time." 

- **X-axis:** Labeled as "Average Group Differences," with values ranging from -2 to 2.
- **Y-axis:** Labeled as "Count," with values ranging from 0 to 17500.
- **Bars:** The histogram consists of vertical bars representing the frequency of average group differences. The distribution is approximately normal, with the highest bar centered around 0, indicating the most common average group difference.
- **Shape:** The histogram is symmetrical, resembling a bell curve, with frequencies decreasing as the values move away from the center in both directions.

The chart visually represents the distribution of average group differences in recovery time, showing how often different values occur by chance.

=== random_variable_2.png ===
The image consists of three main elements arranged horizontally:

1. **Left Element**: 
   - A 3D representation of a gray cube with black outlines. It appears to symbolize a source or container of data.

2. **Middle Element**: 
   - A vertical list of numerical values. The numbers are as follows: 15.2, 12.2, 12.6, 13.2, 14.3, 16.6, 11.0, 15.0, 16.0, 11.8, 19.3, 13.7. 
   - Below these numbers, there are three dots indicating that the list continues.

3. **Right Element**: 
   - A histogram chart with orange bars. The x-axis ranges from 5.0 to 22.5, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 8. The histogram shows the distribution of the numerical data from the middle section.

**Connecting Elements**:
- Two light blue arrows point from the cube to the list of numbers and from the list of numbers to the histogram, indicating a flow or transformation of data from the cube through the list to the histogram.

The overall layout suggests a process of data extraction and visualization.

=== random_variables_same_distro.png ===
The image is a histogram comparing two groups: the Placebo Group and the Drug Group. 

- **Axes**: 
  - The x-axis ranges from 5.0 to 22.5, with intervals marked at 2.5 units.
  - The y-axis ranges from 0 to 11, with intervals marked at 1 unit.

- **Bars**:
  - The histogram displays overlapping bars for each group.
  - The Placebo Group is represented by blue bars.
  - The Drug Group is represented by orange bars.
  - The bars are clustered around the center of the x-axis range, with most data points between 10 and 20.

- **Distribution**:
  - The Placebo Group has a peak around the 17.5 mark.
  - The Drug Group has a peak around the 12.5 mark.
  - Both groups show a distribution that appears to be roughly normal, with a concentration of values in the middle range and tapering off towards the edges.

- **Legend**:
  - Located in the upper right corner, indicating the color coding for each group.

The histogram visually compares the frequency distribution of two groups, showing differences in their central tendencies and spread.

=== random_variable_1.png ===
The image consists of three main components arranged horizontally:

1. **Left Side**: There is a simple illustration of a 3D gray box. The box is depicted with black outlines and shading to give it a three-dimensional appearance.

2. **Center**: A vertical list of numerical values is displayed. The numbers are as follows: 15.0, 19.5, 15.8, 15.3, 12.6, 15.5, 19.2, 14.5, 17.0, 17.7, 16.9, 11.4, followed by ellipsis (three dots) indicating continuation.

3. **Right Side**: A histogram is shown. It is a bar graph with blue bars representing the frequency distribution of the numerical data. The x-axis ranges from 5.0 to 22.5, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 10. The histogram shows a peak around the 15.0 to 17.5 range.

Additionally, there are two light blue arrows. The first arrow points from the gray box to the list of numbers, and the second arrow points from the list of numbers to the histogram, suggesting a flow or transformation of data from the box to the histogram.

=== relevant_irrelevant_hyperparameter.png ===
The image consists of two line graphs side by side, each illustrating the relationship between parameter value and EA (Evolutionary Algorithm) performance.

**Left Graph:**
- The graph is labeled "Relevant hyperparameter" in red text at the bottom.
- The x-axis is labeled "Parameter value," and the y-axis is labeled "EA performance."
- The curve is red, showing a clear peak, indicating that EA performance varies significantly with changes in parameter value. The performance increases to a peak and then decreases, forming a distinct hill shape.

**Right Graph:**
- The graph is labeled "Irrelevant hyperparameter" in green text at the bottom.
- The x-axis is labeled "Parameter value," and the y-axis is labeled "EA performance."
- The curve is green, relatively flat with minor fluctuations, indicating that EA performance remains mostly unchanged across different parameter values, suggesting the parameter is irrelevant.

Both graphs have arrows on the y-axis indicating an increase in EA performance. The overall theme contrasts the impact of relevant versus irrelevant hyperparameters on performance.

=== problem_vs_hyperparameter_vs_performance.png ===
The image consists of two 3D surface plots side by side. Both plots depict a relationship between three variables: "Problem," "Parameter Value," and "Performance."

### Left Plot:
- **Axes:**
  - The x-axis is labeled "Problem" and ranges from 0 to 1.
  - The y-axis is labeled "Parameter Value" and ranges from 0 to 1.
  - The z-axis is labeled "Performance" and ranges from 0.5 to 1.
- **Surface:**
  - The surface is a smooth, undulating shape.
  - It starts at a lower performance level and rises to a peak before descending slightly.
  - The surface has a gentle slope on the left and a steeper slope on the right.

### Right Plot:
- **Axes:**
  - The x-axis is labeled "Problem" and ranges from 0 to 1.
  - The y-axis is labeled "Parameter Value" and ranges from 0 to 1.
  - The z-axis is labeled "Performance" and ranges from 0.5 to 1.
- **Surface:**
  - The surface is similar in shape to the left plot but with variations in the contours.
  - It starts at a lower performance level and gradually rises to a peak.
  - The surface has a more pronounced peak and a smoother descent.

### General Observations:
- Both plots are grayscale with grid lines for reference.
- The surfaces are semi-transparent, allowing the grid lines to be visible through them.
- The plots appear to be comparing different scenarios or models, as indicated by the differences in surface shapes.

These plots likely represent how performance varies with different parameter values across various problems.
