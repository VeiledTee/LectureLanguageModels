=== 8_queens.png ===
The image depicts a chessboard with an 8x8 grid. The squares alternate between light and dark colors, starting with a light square in the bottom left corner (a1). The board is labeled with coordinates: letters (a to h) along the top and bottom, and numbers (1 to 8) along the sides.

There are eight queens placed on the board, one on each row, as follows:

- a1: Queen
- c2: Queen
- e3: Queen
- b4: Queen
- d5: Queen
- h6: Queen
- f7: Queen
- g8: Queen

This arrangement is a solution to the eight queens puzzle, where no two queens threaten each other.

=== tsp_horse.png ===
The image is a black and white illustration of a horse's head, created using a maze-like pattern. The outline of the horse's head is clearly defined, with intricate, interconnected lines filling the interior space. These lines form a continuous, complex maze that mimics the contours and features of the horse, such as the ears, mane, eyes, and muzzle. The overall effect is abstract yet recognizable, with the maze lines varying in thickness and direction to suggest the texture and shape of the horse's head. The background is plain white, emphasizing the detailed line work of the maze.

=== 10_queens.png ===
The image is a 10x10 chessboard with alternating light and dark squares. The columns are labeled a to j, and the rows are numbered 1 to 10. The board contains ten queens, each represented by a standard chess queen symbol. The queens are placed on the following squares:

- a2
- b4
- c6
- d8
- e1
- f3
- g5
- h7
- i9
- j10

Each queen is positioned on a different row and column, suggesting a solution to the N-queens problem on a 10x10 board.

=== tsp_arbitrary_path.png ===
The image depicts a simple undirected graph with six vertices and several edges. The vertices are represented by black circles with numbers inside them, ranging from 0 to 5. The edges are depicted as red lines connecting the vertices. Here is a detailed description:

- Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 3.
- Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 4.
- Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 4.
- Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 0 and 2.
- Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and 5.
- Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 4.

The edges form a network that appears to be a simple graph with no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

The image is completely black, indicating no visible content or discernible features. It may be an image taken in darkness, or it could be an error in image capture or display. There are no colors, shapes, or objects visible.

=== genotype_phenotype_space.png ===
The image illustrates the relationship between phenotype space and genotype space through encoding and decoding processes.

1. **Phenotype Space**:
   - Represented by an irregular, polygonal shape on the left.
   - Contains numbers: 18, 2, and 9, which likely represent different phenotypic traits or values.

2. **Genotype Space**:
   - Depicted as a cube on the right.
   - Contains binary strings: 10010, 00010, and 01001, which likely represent genetic information or codes.

3. **Encoding (Representation)**:
   - An arrow labeled "Encoding (representation)" points from the phenotype space to the genotype space.
   - This suggests a process of translating phenotypic traits into genetic codes.

4. **Decoding (Inverse Representation)**:
   - An arrow labeled "Decoding (inverse representation)" points from the genotype space back to the phenotype space.
   - This indicates the process of translating genetic codes back into phenotypic traits.

5. **Labels**:
   - "Phenotype space" is written in blue above the irregular shape.
   - "Genotype space" is written in orange above the cube.

The image effectively conveys the concept of encoding and decoding between phenotype and genotype spaces.
