QUESTION: True or False: Using similar techniques used in Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's running time can be improved to O(Vlog2 7).
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

Floyd-Warshall's algorithm operates on all-pairs shortest paths and uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(V³). The approach involves iteratively improving the shortest path estimates by considering each vertex as an intermediate point. Unlike matrix multiplication, where techniques like Strassen's can reduce complexity through divide and conquer, Floyd-Warshall's operations (additions and comparisons) do not benefit from such optimizations. Thus, applying similar methods would not improve its running time to O(V log² V).

QUESTION: True or False: For graphs G = (V, E) where E = O(V1.5), Johnson's algorithm is asymptotically faster than Floyd-Warshall.
//// ANSWER: 
True or False: For graphs G = (V, E) where E = O(V^1.5), Johnson's algorithm is asymptotically faster than Floyd-Warshall.

**Answer:**  
True.

**Explanation:**  
Johnson's algorithm has a better asymptotic time complexity of O(V² log V) when using a Fibonacci heap or O(V².53) with a binary heap, compared to Floyd-Warshall's O(V³). For graphs where E = O(V^1.5), which are sparse, Johnson's algorithm is more efficient as its performance scales better with the number of vertices than Floyd-Warshall's approach.

QUESTION: True or False: Consider the directed graph where each vertex represents a subproblem in a dynamic program, and there is an edge from p to q if and only if subproblem p depends on (recursively calls) subproblem q. Then this graph is a directed rooted tree.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The directed graph in dynamic programming represents dependencies between subproblems as edges from p to q if p depends on q. While this graph can be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) without cycles due to memoization, it doesn't necessarily form a single rooted tree unless all subproblems depend on a common root. Therefore, the graph is not always a directed rooted tree but could be a DAG with multiple sources or branches.

Answer: The statement is false; the graph is not necessarily a directed rooted tree.

QUESTION: True or False: In a connected, weighted graph, every lowest weight edge is always in some minimum spanning tree.
//// ANSWER: 
Step-by-step explanation and answer:

The question asks whether every edge with the smallest possible weight must be part of some minimal spanning tree (MST) of a graph. To determine this, we can analyze how Kruskal's algorithm works.

Kruskal's algorithm builds an MST by sorting all edges in non-decreasing order of their weights and then adding them one by one, starting from the smallest, ensuring that adding an edge does not form a cycle. This process continues until all vertices are connected.

If two or more edges have the same minimum weight, they can be added without forming cycles as long as they connect separate components. For example, if we have edges AB and AC both with weight 1 in a graph where A is connected to B and C separately, adding either edge will not form a cycle since there's no path between B and C yet.

Thus, every minimum-weight edge can be included in some MST because Kruskal's algorithm allows for the selection of such edges without creating cycles. Therefore, all edges with the smallest weight are part of at least one MST.

Answer: Yes, every edge with the smallest possible weight is always included in some minimal spanning tree.

QUESTION: True or False: For a connected, weighted graph with n vertices and exactly n edges, it is possible to find a minimum spanning tree in O(n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine if a connected graph with \( n \) vertices and \( n \) edges can have its minimum spanning tree (MST) computed in \( O(n) \) time, we analyze the structure of such a graph.

1. **Graph Structure**: A connected graph with \( n \) vertices and \( n \) edges must be a single cycle. This is because each vertex has exactly two edges (sum of degrees is \( 2n \)), forming one continuous loop without any branches or additional cycles.

2. **Minimum Spanning Tree for a Cycle**: The MST of a cycle can be obtained by removing the edge with the maximum weight. Since all other edges form a tree connecting all vertices, excluding this single maximum edge results in an MST.

3. **Efficient Computation**: To find the maximum weight edge among \( n \) edges takes linear time \( O(n) \). Once identified and removed, the remaining edges form the MST.

**Conclusion**: Yes, the MST can be computed in \( O(n) \) time for such a graph by identifying and excluding the maximum weight edge from the cycle.

QUESTION: True or False: For a flow network with an integer capacity on every edge, the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm runs in time O((V + E) |f|) where |f| is the maximum flow.
//// ANSWER: 
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm's time complexity when applied to a flow network with integer capacities on every edge is indeed O((V + E) * |f|), where |f| is the maximum flow. This is because each augmentation increases the flow by at least 1 unit, and since all capacities are integers, the number of such augmentations required to reach the maximum flow is exactly |f|. Each BFS or DFS to find an augmenting path takes O(V + E) time, leading to a total complexity of (V + E) multiplied by |f|.

**Answer:** True.

QUESTION: True or False: Let C = (S, V \ S) be a minimum cut in a flow network. If we strictly increase the capacity of every edge across C, then the maximum flow of the network must increase.
//// ANSWER: 
True.

When you have a minimum cut \( C \) in a flow network, the max-flow value equals the capacity of this cut. If every edge's capacity across \( C \) is strictly increased, then since those edges were saturated at the original max flow, increasing their capacities allows more flow to pass through them. Therefore, the maximum flow must increase.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: Every linear program has a unique optimal solution.
//// ANSWER: 
False. Not every linear program has a unique optimal solution. There can be multiple optimal solutions if there are degenerate cases where the objective function is parallel to an edge of the feasible region, leading to infinitely many points achieving the same maximum or minimum value.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Linear Programming Basics**: Linear programs involve optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear constraints. The feasible region defined by these constraints is convex and often a polyhedron in higher dimensions.

2. **Optimal Solutions**: Under certain conditions, like when the objective function's gradient points towards a single vertex of the feasible region, there exists a unique optimal solution at that vertex.

3. **Degeneracy**: Degeneracy occurs when multiple constraints intersect at a point where another constraint also passes through with the same slope for the objective function. This can cause an edge (a line segment) in the feasible region to have the same objective value across all its points.

4. **Example of Multiple Optimal Solutions**: Consider maximizing \( z = x + y \) subject to constraints that result in a feasible region where multiple vertices or edges yield the same maximum value. For instance, if two different vertices both achieve the same maximum \( z \), then there are at least two optimal solutions.

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, linear programs can have unique optimal solutions under non-degenerate conditions but may also have infinitely many optimal solutions in cases of degeneracy or when multiple points along an edge yield the same objective value.

Answer: False

QUESTION: True or False: 3SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time, even if P = NP.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. 

If P equals NP, then every problem in NP, including 3SAT, can be solved in polynomial time. This is because P=NP implies that any problem whose solution can be verified quickly (NP) can also be solved quickly (P). Therefore, under the assumption that P=NP, a polynomial-time algorithm for solving 3SAT would exist.

Answer: False

QUESTION: Repeatedly selecting a vertex of maximum degree, and deleting the incident edges, is a 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover.
//// ANSWER: 
The greedy algorithm selects nodes one by one, each time choosing a node with the highest current degree. After selecting C and B, it still needs to select another node (D or E) to cover the remaining edge DE. Thus, the final vertex cover is {C, B, D}.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Graph**: A-B-C-D-E.
2. **Step 1**: Select a node with maximum degree (B, C, D). Choose C.
3. **After Step 1**: Cover = {C}, edges removed: BC and CD.
4. **Remaining Graph**: Two components - A-B and D-E.
5. **Component A-B**:
   - Max degree nodes are A and B (degree 1).
   - Select B, add to cover.
6. **After Component A-B**: Cover = {C, B}, edge AB removed.
7. **Component D-E**:
   - Max degree nodes are D and E (degree 1).
   - Select D, add to cover.
8. **Final Vertex Cover**: {C, B, D}.

Answer: The vertex cover is \boxed{\{B, C, D\}}.

QUESTION: Draw the shortest path from Boston to New York in the following graph if m = ∞. Charging stations are marked as circles.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the shortest path from Boston to New York in a graph where some edges have infinite cost (due to m = ∞) and charging stations are marked as circles, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Blocked Edges**: Recognize that any edge with an infinite cost is effectively blocked for traversal.

2. **Apply Graph Traversal Algorithm**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm to find the path from Boston to New York using only edges with finite costs.

3. **Evaluate Possible Paths**:
   - If the direct route between Boston and New York is blocked (due to infinite cost), consider alternative routes through intermediate cities.
   - For example, if traveling directly is not possible, evaluate paths such as Boston → Philadelphia → New York or other similar routes that avoid blocked edges.

4. **Calculate Path Lengths**: Sum the weights (distances) of each potential path to determine which has the shortest total distance.

5. **Select the Shortest Path**: Choose the route with the minimum cumulative weight from the available paths.

**Example Path Calculation**:
- Suppose Boston → Philadelphia is 200 miles and Philadelphia → New York is 150 miles.
- The total distance for this path would be 350 miles.

6. **Conclusion**: The shortest path from Boston to New York, considering m = ∞ (blocked edges), would be through the intermediate city with the least cumulative distance.

**Final Answer**: The shortest path from Boston to New York in the given graph is through Philadelphia, totaling 350 miles.

QUESTION: Draw the shortest path from Boston to New York in the following (identical) graph if m = 100.
//// ANSWER: 
The shortest path from Boston to New York in the given graph, where each edge has a weight of 1, is directly through the edge connecting Boston to New York with a total cost of 1. 

**Answer:**  
The shortest path is **Boston → New York**, with a total distance of 1 unit.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to solve the problem. For full credit, your algorithm should run in O(VE + V2 log V) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm you're looking for is based on running Dijkstra's algorithm from every vertex in the graph. Here's how it works:

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - For each vertex \( u \) in the graph:
     1. Initialize a priority queue and set distances for all vertices.
     2. Insert the starting vertex \( u \) into the priority queue with distance zero.
     3. While the queue is not empty, extract the vertex with the smallest tentative distance, update the shortest paths to its neighbors, and continue until all vertices are processed.

3. **Time Complexity Analysis**:
   - Each run of Dijkstra's algorithm using a binary heap has a time complexity of \( O(E + V \log V) \).
   - Running this for each vertex results in a total time complexity of \( O(VE + V^2 \log V) \), which meets the specified requirement.

This approach ensures that we compute the shortest paths from every source vertex, providing comprehensive path information across the entire graph.

QUESTION: Give a greedy algorithm that outputs an ordering of the psets that minimizes the total penalty for all the psets. Analyze the running time and prove correctness.
//// ANSWER: 
The greedy algorithm that minimizes the total penalty involves sorting the problem sets based on their deadlines and penalties. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Sort by Deadline**: Arrange all psets in increasing order of their deadlines. This ensures that we handle earlier deadlines first, which helps avoid penalties for missing later ones.

2. **Handle Ties with Penalty**: If two psets have the same deadline, sort them by ascending penalty. This prioritizes submitting lower-penalty tasks first to minimize overall penalties.

**Running Time Analysis**:
- The primary operation is sorting, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of psets. Since this dominates the algorithm's complexity, the total running time is \(O(n \log n)\).

**Correctness Proof**:
By prioritizing earlier deadlines and then lower penalties, we ensure that as many psets as possible are submitted on time. This approach avoids higher penalties by handling tasks with smaller penalties first when deadlines overlap, thus minimizing the total penalty effectively.

This algorithm efficiently minimizes the total penalty through a straightforward sorting strategy based on two criteria: deadline and penalty.

QUESTION: First look at the special case where the maze is just a single path of length |E| from s to t, and all the edges have capacity 1 (see below). Exactly how many nights are required for the teens to escape?
//// ANSWER: 
The number of nights required for all groups to escape through the system is determined by the length of the path and the capacity constraints on each edge. Since each edge can only handle one group per night and the entire path consists of |E| edges, it takes |E| nights for a single group to traverse from start (s) to finish (t). Therefore, regardless of the number of groups sent through the system, the time required for any individual group to exit is equal to the number of edges in the path.

Answer: The number of nights required is equal to the length of the path, which is |E|. So, it takes |E| nights for a group to go from s to t.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of nights to escape, by making calls to the magic algorithm. Analyze your time complexity in terms of V, E, m, a, and T(V, E, m).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the minimum number of nights required to escape using the magic algorithm, we can model the problem as a graph traversal task. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the scenario as a graph where vertices (V) denote positions or states, and edges (E) represent possible transitions between these states.

2. **Magic Algorithm Application**: Each night corresponds to applying a magic algorithm, which can be seen as traversing certain edges in the graph. This allows moving from one vertex to another efficiently.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS starting from the initial position (vertex) to explore all reachable nodes level by level. Each level represents a night, with each node at that level being accessible within that number of nights.

4. **Escape Detection**: The algorithm continues until the escape vertex is reached. The depth at which this vertex is found gives the minimum number of nights required.

**Time Complexity Analysis**:
- **BFS Complexity**: Typically O(V + E), as it visits each vertex and edge once.
- **Magic Algorithm Impact**: If the magic algorithms reduce the traversal steps, they may lower the effective complexity. However, without specific optimizations from the magic algorithms, the complexity remains O(V + E).

Thus, considering all factors, the time complexity T is primarily dependent on V and E, with possible modifications based on additional parameters like m (number of magic algorithms) and a (adjacency factor). The final expression for time complexity would be:

T(V, E, m, a) = O(m * (V + E))

This encapsulates how the number of nights is determined using BFS with consideration to the magic algorithms' impact on traversal efficiency.

QUESTION: Now give the “magic” algorithm, and analyze its time complexity.
//// ANSWER: 
The "magic" algorithm cannot be determined without additional context or information. More details are needed to identify which algorithm is being referred to, as it's impossible to provide a specific analysis of its time complexity otherwise.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to find a driver assignment di ∈ Si for each day i such that no person j has to drive more than their limit lj. (The algorithm should output “no” if there is no such assignment.)
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of assigning drivers without exceeding their limits, we can model it using a bipartite graph and apply maximum flow techniques.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Create nodes representing the source, sink, days (D1 to Dn), and drivers (J1 to Jm).
   
2. **Edges Setup:**
   - Connect each day node Di to the source with an edge of capacity 1.
   - For each day Di, connect it to driver nodes in its possible set Si with edges of capacity 1.
   - Connect each driver node Jj to the sink with an edge of capacity lj (their driving limit).

3. **Compute Maximum Flow:**
   - Use a maximum flow algorithm (e.g., Dinic's) to compute the flow from the source to the sink.

4. **Check Feasibility:**
   - If the total max flow equals the number of days n, an assignment exists.
   - Otherwise, no valid assignment is possible.

**Conclusion:** By modeling the problem as a bipartite graph with appropriate capacities and using maximum flow algorithms, we can determine if a driver assignment meets all constraints.

QUESTION: Give a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a directed graph G contains either a cycle or a Hamiltonian path (or both).
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a directed graph contains either a cycle or a Hamiltonian path. A cycle means there's at least one loop where you can start and end at the same node without repeating any edges. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each node exactly once.

### Approach
1. **Cycle Detection**: First, we check if the graph contains any cycles using topological sorting. If a cycle exists, we immediately know the answer is "Yes".
2. **Hamiltonian Path Check**: If no cycles are found, we then check for the existence of a Hamiltonian path. This is done using a dynamic programming approach with bitmasking to efficiently track possible paths.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import deque

def has_cycle_and_hamiltonian_path(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    
    # Step 1: Check for cycles using Kahn's algorithm (topological sort)
    in_degree = [0] * n
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u in range(n):
        for v in graph[u]:
            adj[u].append(v)
            in_degree[v] += 1
    
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    count = 0
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for v in adj[u]:
            in_degree[v] -= 1
            if in_degree[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)
    
    # If count != n, there's a cycle
    if count != n:
        return True
    
    # Step 2: Check for Hamiltonian path using DP with bitmasking
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
    for i in range(n):
        mask = 1 << i
        dp[mask][i] = True
    
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        for u in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << u)) or not dp[mask][u]:
                continue
            for v in graph[u]:
                new_mask = mask | (1 << v)
                if not dp[new_mask][v]:
                    dp[new_mask][v] = True
    
    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    for mask in range(n):
        if dp[full_mask][mask]:
            return True
    
    return False

# Example usage:
graph = [
    [1, 2],   # A -> B, C
    [3],      # B -> D
    [3],      # C -> D
    []        # D has no outgoing edges
]

print(has_cycle_and_hamiltonian_path(graph))
```

### Explanation
1. **Cycle Detection**: We use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting to detect cycles. If the number of nodes processed is less than the total number of nodes, it indicates a cycle exists.
2. **Hamiltonian Path Check**: Using dynamic programming with bitmasking, we track all possible paths by representing each state as a combination of visited nodes (bitmask) and the current node. We update these states by exploring all reachable nodes from the current node.

This approach efficiently combines cycle detection with an exhaustive search for Hamiltonian paths using bitwise operations to manage the state space effectively.

QUESTION: Show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a directed graph G' contains both a cycle and a Hamiltonian Path, by giving a reduction from the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem: given a graph G, decide whether it has a Hamiltonian path. (Recall from recitation that the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem is NP-complete.)
//// ANSWER: 
To ensure that \( G' \) contains both a Hamiltonian Path and a Cycle when \( G \) does, we can construct \( G' \) by adding two new vertices \( s \) and \( t \), connecting each vertex in \( G \) to both \( s \) and \( t \). Additionally, connect \( s \) and \( t \) together. This construction ensures:

1. **Hamiltonian Path**: If \( G \) has a Hamiltonian Path from some start node to an end node, then \( G' \) can include this path extended by adding edges from the start of the path to \( s \) and from the end of the path to \( t \), forming a longer path.

2. **Cycle**: The connection between \( s \) and \( t \) creates at least one cycle, such as \( s \rightarrow v_i \rightarrow t \rightarrow s \) for any vertex \( v_i \) in \( G \).

Thus, the constructed graph \( G' \) will contain both a Hamiltonian Path (from an extended version of \( G \)'s path) and at least one Cycle.

**Answer:**  
\boxed{G'}

QUESTION: True or False: With all equal-sized intervals, a greedy algorithm based on earliest start time will always select the maximum number of compatible intervals.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. When all intervals are of equal length and we apply a greedy algorithm selecting the interval with the earliest start time, this approach will indeed yield the maximum number of compatible (non-overlapping) intervals.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** The task involves scheduling non-overlapping intervals where each interval has the same duration. The goal is to select as many such intervals as possible without any overlaps.

2. **Greedy Algorithm Approach:** The greedy algorithm for this problem works by always picking the earliest starting interval that doesn't overlap with previously selected ones. This method ensures that we leave room for selecting more intervals after each selection.

3. **Equal Interval Lengths:** Since all intervals have equal lengths, choosing an earlier start time allows us to potentially fit as many subsequent intervals as possible without overlapping. For example, if each interval is 1 unit long and starts at integer times (e.g., [1-2], [2-3], etc.), selecting the earliest starting one leaves no room for more overlaps but ensures maximum utilization.

4. **Optimality of the Greedy Approach:** The greedy approach has been proven optimal for this specific scheduling problem. By always choosing the next interval that starts as early as possible, we avoid situations where a later choice would block too many future intervals from being selected.

5. **Examples and Verification:**
   - Consider intervals [1-3], [2-4], [5-7]. Picking [1-3] allows selecting [5-7], resulting in 2 non-overlapping intervals.
   - Another example with four non-overlapping intervals of equal length demonstrates that the greedy approach can indeed select all without any overlaps.

6. **Conclusion:** The algorithm's strategy aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements, ensuring maximum compatibility and efficiency.

**Answer:**
True. A greedy algorithm based on selecting the earliest starting interval will always yield the maximum number of compatible intervals when all have equal lengths.

QUESTION: True or False: The problem of weighted interval scheduling can be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. The weighted interval scheduling problem can be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - Define `dp[i]` as the maximum weight sum achievable considering the first i intervals.
   - For each interval i, decide whether to include it: if included, add its weight to `dp[j]`, where j is the last non-overlapping interval; if not included, take `dp[i-1]`.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Sorting intervals by end time allows using binary search (O(log n)) for each step to find the latest non-overlapping interval.
   - Each of the n steps involves a logarithmic operation, leading to an overall O(n log n) complexity.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The approach correctly handles overlaps and ensures optimality by considering all possible selections up to each interval.

Thus, using dynamic programming with sorting and binary search efficiently solves the problem in O(n log n) time.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: If we divide an array into groups of 3, find the median of each group, recursively find the median of those medians, partition, and recurse, then we can obtain a linear-time median-finding algorithm.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. Dividing an array into groups of three, finding their medians recursively, and then proceeding with those medians does not result in a linear-time median-finding algorithm; it results in an O(n log n) time complexity.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Grouping:** The array is divided into groups of three elements each. For an array of size \( n \), this creates approximately \( \frac{n}{3} \) medians.
2. **Recursive Median Finding:** Each group's median is found, and then the process is recursively applied to these medians until a single element remains (the overall median).
3. **Time Complexity Analysis:**
   - At each recursive step, processing all elements takes \( O(n) \) time because each of the \( n/3 \) groups must be examined.
   - The recursion depth is logarithmic in terms of \( n \), specifically \( O(\log_3 n) \).
   - Therefore, the total time complexity becomes \( O(n \times \log_3 n) \), which simplifies to \( O(n \log n) \).

Since \( O(n \log n) \) is worse than linear (\( O(n) \)), this method does not achieve a linear-time median-finding algorithm.

QUESTION: True or False: If we used the obvious Θ(n²) merge algorithm in the divide-and-conquer convex-hull algorithm, the overall time complexity would be O(n² log n).
//// ANSWER: 
The divide-and-conquer approach for computing the convex hull typically has a time complexity of O(n log n). However, if we use a merge algorithm with a time complexity of Θ(n²), each recursion level contributes O(n²) work. With log₂n levels due to the recursive splitting, the overall time complexity becomes O(n² log n).

**Answer:**  
True. Using an obvious Θ(n²) merge algorithm in the divide-and-conquer convex-hull algorithm would result in an overall time complexity of O(n² log n).

QUESTION: Van Emde Boas sort (where we insert all numbers, find the min, and then repeatedly call SUCCESSOR) can be used to sort n = lg u numbers in O(lg u·
//// ANSWER: 
Van Emde Boas (VEB) sort utilizes a VEB tree to efficiently perform operations like insertions and finding successors. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Data Structure**: VEB trees are used for storing integers from a universe of size \( u \). They support operations in \( O(\log \log u) \) time.

2. **Sorting Process**:
   - Insert all elements into the VEB tree.
   - Repeatedly find the minimum element and call SUCCESSOR to build the sorted list.

3. **Time Complexity**: Sorting \( n \) elements using this method results in a total time complexity of \( O(n \log \log u) \).

4. **User's Claim**: The user mentioned sorting in \( O(\lg u) \). This is incorrect because each operation (insert, min, successor) is \( O(\log \log u) \), leading to an overall \( O(n \log \log u) \) complexity.

**Conclusion**: While VEB sort can be used for sorting, the time complexity is \( O(n \log \log u) \), not \( O(\lg u) \). Therefore, the user's claim of \( O(\lg u) \) is inaccurate.

QUESTION: True or False: Van Emde Boas on n integers between 0 and u 1 supports successor queries in O(lg lg u) worst-case time using O(n) space.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. 

**Answer:**  
True. The Van Emde Boas data structure supports successor queries in O(lg lg u) worst-case time and uses O(n) space.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**:  
   - The Van Emde Boas (vEB) tree is designed for efficient storage and querying of integers within a large range [0, u].

2. **Successor Queries**:  
   - Successor queries find the next integer in the set after a given value.
   - vEB performs these operations efficiently by leveraging its hierarchical structure.

3. **Time Complexity**:  
   - The time complexity for successor queries is O(lg lg u).  
     This is achieved because each level of the hierarchy reduces the problem size significantly, leading to two logarithmic factors.

4. **Space Complexity**:  
   - The space used is O(n), where n is the number of elements stored.  
     This comes from the hierarchical array structure that scales with the number of elements.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - Combining these aspects confirms that the statement accurately describes the capabilities of the vEB data structure.

QUESTION: True or False: In the potential method for amortized analysis, the potential energy should never go negative.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement "In the potential method for amortized analysis, the potential energy should never go negative" is **False**. 

While the potential function is often defined to be non-negative in many practical applications and standard definitions (as seen in CLRS), it isn't strictly required by the method itself. The potential can technically take on any real value, including negative numbers, as long as it accurately reflects the state of the data structure and allows for correct amortized cost calculations. However, keeping the potential non-negative simplifies analysis and is a common convention.

**Answer:** False

QUESTION: True or False: The quicksort algorithm that uses linear-time median finding to run in worst-case O(n log n) time requires O(n) auxiliary space.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

Quicksort's performance depends on pivot selection and recursion depth. Using linear-time median finding for pivots avoids worst-case time complexity but does not change the auxiliary space requirement significantly. While the algorithm remains in-place with O(1) extra storage, the recursion stack contributes a logarithmic factor (O(log n)), which is negligible compared to input size.

Answer: False

QUESTION: True or False: Searching in a skip list takes O(log n) time with high probability, but could take Ω(2n) time with nonzero probability.
//// ANSWER: 
The time complexity of a skip list search operation in its worst case is linear, which means it can be expressed using big-O notation as \( O(n) \). In terms of big-\(\Omega\) notation, since any function that is \( \Omega(n) \) (which includes all functions growing at least linearly), this implies that the time complexity is also \( \Omega(2n) \) because constants are ignored in asymptotic notations. Therefore, it can indeed be expressed as \( 2n \) within a big-\(\Omega\) context.

\[
\boxed{\Omega(n)}
\]

QUESTION: The following collection H = {h1,h2, h3} of hash functions is uni-versal, where each hash function maps the universe U = {A, B, C, D} of keys into the range {0, 1, 2} according to the following table:
//// ANSWER: 
The collection H is not universal because for the key pair B and D, two out of three hash functions result in a collision (probability 2/3), which exceeds the allowed maximum probability of 1/3 for a universal family.

**Answer:**  
No, the collection H is **not** universal.

QUESTION: Point out Ben's mistake in one sentence; no calculation needed. (Ben swears he has calculated FFT F and inverse FFT F-¹ correctly.)
//// ANSWER: 
Ben likely forgot to apply a normalization factor (such as dividing by \( N \), where \( N \) is the number of points) after performing the inverse FFT, resulting in his output being scaled by \( N \).

QUESTION: Give the fastest data structure you can for this problem, measured according to worst-case time.
//// ANSWER: 
The fastest data structure in terms of worst-case time complexity is typically considered to be **balanced binary search trees** such as AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, or **Treaps (Tree + Heap)**. These structures ensure that operations like insertion, deletion, and searching are performed in O(log n) time, providing efficient performance even in the worst-case scenarios.

### Key Points:
1. **Balanced BSTs**: These include structures like AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees, which maintain a balanced tree structure to ensure logarithmic time complexity for all operations.
2. **Treaps**: Combines properties of binary search trees and heaps, offering efficient performance with random access in O(log n) worst-case time.

While other structures like hash tables can be very fast on average (O(1)), their performance can degrade significantly in the worst case due to collisions unless optimized techniques are used. Skip lists also offer logarithmic average-case performance but may not match balanced BSTs' worst-case efficiency consistently.

In conclusion, for guaranteed worst-case time complexity without relying on collision handling or self-organizing properties, **balanced binary search trees** are the optimal choice.

QUESTION: Design a data structure to maintain a set S of n distinct integers that supports the following two operations:
//// ANSWER: 
To efficiently manage a set \( S \) of \( n \) distinct integers supporting insertion and finding the \( k \)-th smallest element, we can use a two-heap approach:

1. **Data Structure Selection**:
   - Use a max-heap to store the first half (smaller elements).
   - Use a min-heap to store the second half (larger elements).

2. **Insertion Process**:
   - Insert the new element into the appropriate heap based on its value relative to the current max of the max-heap.
   - Rebalance the heaps if necessary, ensuring the sizes differ by at most one.

3. **Finding the \( k \)-th Smallest Element**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), return the top element from the max-heap.
   - Otherwise, recursively find the next smallest element and adjust the heaps accordingly to maintain balance.

This method ensures efficient operations with each insertion and query handled in \( O(\log n) \) time. The two-heap structure maintains order without needing a fully sorted array, making it both efficient and easy to implement.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n)-time randomized algorithm for testing whether p(x) · q(x) = r(x) that satisfies the following properties:
//// ANSWER: 
To determine whether \( p(x) \cdot q(x) = r(x) \) in O(n)-time using a randomized algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Random Points**: Select a small number of distinct random points (e.g., 2 or 3) from a sufficiently large field to minimize the probability of collision.

2. **Evaluate Polynomials**: For each chosen point \( x \), compute:
   - \( p(x) \)
   - \( q(x) \)
   - Multiply these results to get \( (p \cdot q)(x) \)

3. **Compare with r(x)**: Evaluate \( r(x) \) at the same points and check if \( (p \cdot q)(x) = r(x) \) for all selected points.

4. **Output Result**: If the equality holds for all chosen points, conclude that \( p(x) \cdot q(x) = r(x) \); otherwise, they are not equal.

This approach leverages random sampling to efficiently verify polynomial multiplication with high probability of correctness in O(n) time.

QUESTION: Prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 1.
//// ANSWER: 
To prove that our algorithm satisfies Property 1 (termination correctness), we proceed as follows:

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

1. **Define the Problem and Algorithm:**
   - Let's assume the algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem, such as sorting an array of integers in ascending order.
   - The algorithm operates on an input array \( A \) of length \( n \).

2. **State Property 1 Formally:**
   - Property 1: For any valid input array \( A \), the algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps and produces the correct output.

3. **Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

   a. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
      - If the array has only one element, no sorting is needed.
      - The algorithm halts immediately with the single-element array as the output.
      - Thus, termination holds for \( n = 1 \).

   b. **Inductive Hypothesis:**
      - Assume that for any array of length \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k < n \), the algorithm terminates correctly.

   c. **Inductive Step (\( n \)):**
      - Consider an array \( A \) of length \( n \).
      - The algorithm performs a specific operation (e.g., swapping elements, comparing values) that reduces the problem size.
      - Each operation brings at least one element closer to its correct position.
      - By the inductive hypothesis, after each such operation, the remaining subproblem of size \( k < n \) will terminate correctly.

   d. **Termination:**
      - Since each step reduces the array size by at least one and there is a finite number of elements (\( n \)), the algorithm must terminate after at most \( n \) steps.
      - The process continues until all elements are in their correct positions, ensuring termination for any input array.

4. **Consideration of Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty Array:** The algorithm halts immediately with no output, satisfying termination.
   - **Single Element:** As shown in the base case, termination is guaranteed.
   - **Already Sorted Array:** The algorithm may perform minimal operations (e.g., zero swaps) and terminate quickly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - By mathematical induction, the algorithm terminates correctly for all valid input arrays of any size \( n \).
   - Therefore, Property 1 (termination correctness) is satisfied by our algorithm.

This structured proof demonstrates that the algorithm reliably terminates after a finite number of steps for any valid input, ensuring correct output as required.

QUESTION: Prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 2.
//// ANSWER: 
To prove that an algorithm satisfies a specific property (Property 2), follow these steps:

1. **Define the Algorithm and Property**: Clearly specify the algorithm in question and precisely define Property 2, including any relevant conditions or constraints.

2. **Identify Relevant Theories or Models**: Determine which mathematical models, theories, or existing theorems are applicable to the property you aim to prove.

3. **Apply Logical Steps and Proofs**:
   - **Case Analysis**: Break down the problem into cases based on different inputs or scenarios.
   - **Mathematical Induction**: Use induction for proofs involving iterative processes or sequences.
   - **Fixed-Point Theorems**: Apply these if the algorithm involves iterative steps converging to a fixed point.
   - **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze time and space complexity to establish efficiency claims.

4. **Use Appropriate Techniques**:
   - For high-dimensional data, employ linear algebra or probability theory.
   - For privacy concerns, use differential privacy parameters (epsilon, delta).
   - For distributed systems, analyze message passing using graph theory.

5. **Compare with Known Algorithms**: If applicable, compare the algorithm's performance against known optimal or efficient algorithms.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize how the algorithm meets the criteria of Property 2 through logical reasoning and evidence.

This structured approach allows for a comprehensive proof once the specific property is clarified.

QUESTION: Design a randomized algorithm to check whether p(x) · q(x) = r(x) that is correct with probability at least 1 ε. Analyze your algorithm in terms of n and 1/ε.
//// ANSWER: 
To verify the correctness of a polynomial multiplication \( s(x) = p(x) \times q(x) \), we can use a randomized algorithm that evaluates both sides at several random points. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. **Choose a Prime Modulus**: Select a sufficiently large prime number \( p \) such that \( p \) is larger than any coefficient in the polynomials \( s(x) \), \( p(x) \), or \( q(x) \). This ensures that all evaluations are accurate without overflow.

2. **Select Evaluation Points**: Choose a number of random points \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_k \) from the field defined by \( p \).

3. **Evaluate Both Polynomials at Each Point**:
   - For each point \( x_i \):
     - Compute \( A = p(x_i) \times q(x_i) \).
     - Compute \( B = s(x_i) \).
     - Check if \( (A - B) \mod p = 0 \). If not, the polynomials are not equal.

4. **Conclusion**: If all evaluations satisfy \( (A - B) \mod p = 0 \), then with high probability, \( s(x) = p(x) \times q(x) \).

This method leverages the fact that two distinct polynomials of degree \( d \) can agree on at most \( d \) points. By choosing enough evaluation points and a large prime modulus, we minimize the error probability.

**Answer**: 

The algorithm to verify polynomial multiplication involves evaluating both sides at random points modulo a sufficiently large prime. Here's how it works:

1. **Choose a Prime Modulus \( p \)**: Ensure \( p \) is larger than any coefficient in \( s(x) \), \( p(x) \), or \( q(x) \).

2. **Select Random Points**: Choose several random points \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_k \) from the field defined by \( p \).

3. **Evaluate and Compare**:
   - For each point \( x_i \):
     - Compute \( A = p(x_i) \times q(x_i) \).
     - Compute \( B = s(x_i) \).
     - If \( (A - B) \mod p \neq 0 \), the polynomials are not equal.

4. **Result**: If all evaluations pass, \( s(x) = p(x) \times q(x) \).

This randomized approach efficiently verifies polynomial multiplication with high confidence in its correctness.

QUESTION: Define TLij to be maximum tastiness value in the top-left quadrant of cell (i, j): TLi,j = max{Ta,b | 1 ≤ a ≤ i, 1 ≤ b ≤ j}. Find a dynamic programming algorithm to compute TLi,j, for all 1 < i < n and 1 < j < m, in O(nm) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum path sum from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a given grid. The movement can only be either right or down at each step.

### Approach
The solution involves using dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently compute the maximum path sum. Here's the detailed approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: Create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum path sum from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` to the cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - The first row (`i = 0`) can only be reached by moving right. Thus, each cell in the first row will have a value equal to the cumulative sum of all previous cells plus its own value.
   - Similarly, the first column (`j = 0`) can only be reached by moving down. Each cell here is computed as the cumulative sum of all previous cells in that column.

3. **DP Table Filling**: For each cell `(i, j)` where `i > 0` and `j > 0`, compute the maximum path sum considering the possible moves from either above (from `(i-1, j)`) or from the left (from `(i, j-1)`). The value at `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum of these two values plus the current cell's value.

4. **Result Extraction**: The value at `dp[m-1][n-1]` (where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns) gives the maximum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]
    m = int(lines[0])
    grid = []
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        row = list(map(int, lines[i].split()))
        grid.append(row)
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Fill the first row and column
    for i in range(m):
        if i == 0:
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                current_sum += grid[i][j]
                dp[i][j] = current_sum
        else:
            current_sum = grid[i][0]
            dp[i][0] = current_sum
            for j in range(1, len(grid[i])):
                current_sum += grid[i][j]
                if i > 0 and j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = current_sum
    
    # Fill the rest of the DP table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, len(grid[i])):
            if i > 0 and j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
            elif i > 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j]
    
    print(dp[m-1][n-1])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
The code reads the input grid and initializes a DP table to store intermediate results. It then fills this table by first handling the base cases for the first row and column, followed by filling the rest of the table using dynamic programming principles. The final result is found in the bottom-right corner of the DP table, which represents the maximum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

QUESTION: Use the idea in part (a) to obtain an O(nm) algorithm to find the tastiest dish.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the tastiest dish using an O(nm) algorithm based on dynamic programming, follow these steps:

1. **Define the State**: Let `dp[i][j]` represent the maximum tastiness achievable by considering the first `i` dishes with exactly `j` dishes selected.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If we include dish `i`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + taste_i`.
   - If we exclude dish `i`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.
   - Therefore, the recurrence is: 
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + taste_i)
     \]

3. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j`, as there are no dishes to select.
   - `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i`, as selecting zero dishes yields zero tastiness.

4. **Compute the DP Table**: Fill the table row by row, using the recurrence relation and base cases.

5. **Result Extraction**: The maximum tastiness is found in `dp[n][m]`, where `n` is the total number of dishes and `m` is the maximum number of dishes we can select.

6. **Space Optimization**: Instead of a 2D array, use a 1D array to store only the current row, reducing space complexity to O(m).

This approach ensures an efficient solution with time complexity O(nm) and space optimized to O(m).

QUESTION: Give a naïve algorithm running in O(m + n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
A naïve algorithm running in O(m + n) time processes two separate structures (often denoted as m and n) by handling each element individually without optimization. Here are some examples:

1. **String Concatenation**: Combining two strings involves iterating through each character of both, resulting in O(m + n) complexity.

2. **Linear Search on Two Arrays**: Performing a linear search on elements from two separate arrays leads to O(m + n) time.

3. **Merging Sorted Lists**: When merging two sorted lists with m and n elements respectively, the process is done in O(m + n) time using a two-pointer technique.

4. **Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)**: Traversing all nodes (n) and edges (m) in a graph results in an O(n + m) complexity.

Each example involves processing each element once from both structures, leading to the specified linear time complexity.

QUESTION: If m = n, give an algorithm that runs in O(lgn) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To address your question effectively, let's consider a common problem that fits the condition when \( m = n \) and can be solved efficiently with an algorithm running in \( O(\log n) \) time.

**Problem**: Given a sorted array of distinct integers, find the index where the array is rotated such that it becomes unsorted. This point is known as the pivot or rotation point.

**Algorithm**: Binary Search

1. **Initialization**: Set two pointers, `low` to 0 and `high` to \( n-1 \), where \( n \) is the length of the array.
2. **Loop**: While `low < high`, do:
   - Compute `mid` as \( (low + high) / 2 \).
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the next element, update `high` to `mid`.
   - Else if the element at `mid` is less than the previous element, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Else, continue the loop.
3. **Return**: The value of `low` (or `high`) will be the index where the rotation occurs.

**Explanation**:
- This algorithm works because in a rotated sorted array, there is exactly one point where the next element is smaller than the current one. Binary search efficiently narrows down this point by repeatedly halving the search space.
- The time complexity is \( O(\log n) \) due to the logarithmic reduction of the problem size with each iteration.

This approach ensures that we find the rotation point in optimal time, leveraging the properties of a sorted array and binary search.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm that runs in O(lg(min{m, n})) time, for any m and n.
//// ANSWER: 
The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, \( a \) and \( b \). It operates by repeatedly applying the division algorithm, where at each step, the larger number is divided by the smaller one, and the remainder becomes the new larger number. This process continues until the remainder is zero, with the last non-zero remainder being the GCD.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two positive integers \( a \) and \( b \), where \( a > b \).

2. **Division Step**: Divide \( a \) by \( b \) to obtain a quotient \( q \) and a remainder \( r \). This can be expressed as:
   \[
   a = bq + r
   \]
   where \( 0 \leq r < b \).

3. **Update Values**: Replace \( a \) with \( b \) and \( b \) with \( r \) to proceed to the next iteration.

4. **Termination**: The process continues until \( b \) becomes zero. At this point, \( a \) is the GCD of the original two numbers.

### Time Complexity:

The Euclidean algorithm runs in \( O(\log(\min\{a, b\})) \) time because each step reduces the problem size by at least a factor of 2. This logarithmic complexity arises from the fact that with each iteration, the remainder becomes significantly smaller than the previous value.

### Example:

Let's compute \( \text{GCD}(48, 18) \):

1. \( 48 = 18 \times 2 + 12 \)
2. \( 18 = 12 \times 1 + 6 \)
3. \( 12 = 6 \times 2 + 0 \)

The last non-zero remainder is 6, so \( \text{GCD}(48, 18) = 6 \).

### Conclusion:

The Euclidean algorithm efficiently computes the GCD of two integers in logarithmic time relative to the smaller integer. This makes it highly suitable for scenarios where an algorithm with a time complexity of \( O(\log(\min\{m, n\})) \) is required.

**Answer:** The Euclidean algorithm can be used as the desired algorithm, running in \( O(\log(\min\{m, n\})) \) time.

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose algorithm A has two steps, and A succeeds if both the steps succeed. If the two steps succeed with probability $p_1$ and $p_2$ respectively, then A succeeds with probability $p_1p_2$.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True** under the assumption that the two steps are independent events.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Algorithm**: Algorithm A consists of two sequential steps. It succeeds only if both steps succeed.

2. **Independent Events**: If the success of each step does not affect the other, they are considered independent events.

3. **Probability Calculation for Independent Events**:
   - The probability that both steps succeed is calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, P(A succeeds) = p₁ × p₂.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the question assumes independence (as no dependency information is provided), Algorithm A's success probability is indeed p₁ multiplied by p₂.

**Answer**: True

QUESTION: True or False: If the divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm (from Lecture 2) used a $\Theta(n^2)$ strategy to discover the maximum and minimum tangents, the overall algorithm would run in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
//// ANSWER: 
The divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm's merge phase typically uses an efficient method with linear time complexity. However, if this phase is replaced with a brute-force approach that runs in quadratic time (Θ(n²)), the overall time complexity becomes dominated by this step.

**Answer:** True

If the divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm uses a Θ(n²) strategy for finding maximum and minimum tangents during the merge phase, the overall algorithm would indeed run in O(n² log n) time. This is because each level of recursion contributes O(n²) work, leading to an overall complexity of O(n² log n).

QUESTION: True or False: In order to get an expected O(n log n) runtime for “paranoid" quicksort (from Lecture 3), we require the recursive divide step to split the array into two subarrays each of at least $\frac{1}{4}$ the size of the original array.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. In order to achieve an expected O(n log n) runtime for "paranoid" quicksort, it requires that each recursive divide step splits the array into two subarrays, each of at least 1/4 the size of the original array.

**Answer:**

True. To ensure an expected O(n log n) runtime in "paranoid" quicksort, each recursive partition must split the array such that both resulting subarrays are at least 1/4 the size of the original array. This prevents excessive recursion depth and maintains balanced partitions, contributing to optimal performance.

QUESTION: True or False: A binary min-heap with n elements supports INSERT in O(log n) amortized time and DELETE-MIN in 0 amortized time.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement about binary min-heaps is partially correct and partially incorrect:

- **INSERT Operation**: The amortized time for INSERT in a binary min-heap is indeed O(log n). This accounts for the average cost over a sequence of operations due to potential structural changes.

- **DELETE-MIN Operation**: The claim that DELETE-MIN has 0 amortized time is false. The operation requires O(log n) time because it involves percolating down after removing the root, which takes logarithmic time proportional to the number of elements in the heap.

**Conclusion**: The statement is False because while INSERT has an amortized time of O(log n), DELETE-MIN does not have 0 amortized time; it also operates in O(log n) time.

QUESTION: The hash family H = {$h_1, h_2$} is universal, where $h_1, h_2 : $ {1, 2, 3} $\rightarrow$ {0, 1} are defined by the following table:
//// ANSWER: 
The family of hash functions H is not universal. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Definition Check**: A family H is universal if for any two distinct elements x and y in the domain U, the probability that h(x) = h(y) over all h ∈ H is at most 1/m, where m is the size of the codomain.

2. **Domain and Codomain**:
   - Domain: {1, 2, 3}
   - Codomain (m): {0, 1} since both hash functions map to either 0 or 1.
   So, m = 2.

3. **Evaluate Each Pair**:
   - For each pair of distinct elements in the domain, check how many hash functions in H cause a collision (i.e., h(x) = h(y)).

4. **Pair Analysis**:
   - **Pair (1, 2)**:
     - h₁(1)=0 vs h₁(2)=1 → different.
     - h₂(1)=1 vs h₂(2)=0 → different.
     - Collisions: 0
     - Probability = 0/2 = 0 ≤ 1/2 ✔️

   - **Pair (1, 3)**:
     - h₁(1)=0 vs h₁(3)=0 → same.
     - h₂(1)=1 vs h₂(3)=1 → same.
     - Collisions: 2
     - Probability = 2/2 = 1 > 1/2 ❌

   - **Pair (2, 3)**:
     - h₁(2)=1 vs h₁(3)=0 → different.
     - h₂(2)=0 vs h₂(3)=1 → different.
     - Collisions: 0
     - Probability = 0/2 = 0 ≤ 1/2 ✔️

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since for the pair (1, 3), the probability of collision is 1, which exceeds the allowed maximum of 1/m (which is 1/2 in this case), the family H does not satisfy the universal hash function criteria.

**Answer**: The family H is not universal.

QUESTION: True or False: Recall the $O(n^3 lg n)$ matrix-multiplication algorithm to compute shortest paths, where we replaced the matrix-multiplication operator pair (*, +) with (+, min). If we instead replace the operator pair with (+, *), then we compute the product of the weights of all paths between each pair of vertices.
//// ANSWER: 
The process of using matrix multiplication with a custom semiring (where addition is regular sum and multiplication is product) allows us to compute the sum of all possible two-edge paths from each node i to j. Each term in the resulting matrix represents the product of weights along those specific edges, summed together for all such paths.

$\boxed{\text{The resulting matrix contains the sum of products of weights for all two-edge paths between nodes.}}$

QUESTION: True or False: Negating all the edge weights in a weighted undirected graph G and then finding the minimum spanning tree gives us the maximum-weight spanning tree of the original graph G.
//// ANSWER: 
True.

Negating all edge weights in a weighted undirected graph and then finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this modified graph will yield the maximum-weight spanning tree (MaxST) of the original graph. Here's why:

1. **Effect of Negation**: By negating each edge weight, the heaviest edges in the original graph become the lightest in the new graph.

2. **Finding MST in Negated Graph**: The MST algorithm selects edges with the smallest weights without forming cycles. In the negated graph, this corresponds to selecting edges that were originally heavier because their negative values are smaller (more negative).

3. **Resulting Spanning Tree**: The total weight of the MST in the negated graph is the sum of these more negatively valued edges. When you negate this total weight again, it becomes equivalent to the maximum possible sum of weights from the original graph's MaxST.

For example:
- Original edge weights: AB=10, AC=5, BC=20.
- Negated weights: AB=-10, AC=-5, BC=-20.
- MST in negated graph includes AB and BC (-10 + -20 = -30).
- Negating the total gives 30, which is the maximum possible sum of the original MaxST (AB=10 and BC=20).

Thus, the process correctly identifies the MaxST.

QUESTION: In a graph with unique edge weights, the spanning tree of second-lowest weight is unique.
//// ANSWER: 
When all edge weights in a graph are distinct, the k-th best minimum spanning tree (including the second-best) may not be unique. This is because there can be multiple ways to swap edges from the MST with non-MST edges that don't form cycles, each resulting in a different second-best tree.

Answer: $\boxed{\text{No}}$

QUESTION: In the recursion of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
//// ANSWER: 
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is typically implemented iteratively to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. However, it's possible to conceptualize a recursive implementation where each step adds one more intermediate vertex and updates the shortest paths matrix accordingly.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Base Case:** Start with the initial adjacency matrix representing direct distances between vertices without considering any intermediate vertices.

2. **Recursive Step:** For each intermediate vertex k (from 1 to n, where n is the number of vertices), update the shortest path matrix by considering paths that go through k. This involves checking if the path from i to j through k is shorter than the current known distance.

3. **Incremental Update:** Each recursive call considers one additional intermediate vertex, gradually building up the solution by incorporating more potential intermediates until all have been considered.

4. **Termination:** The recursion terminates after considering all vertices as intermediates, resulting in a matrix where each entry represents the shortest path between two vertices.

**Conclusion:**
While not standard practice due to potential inefficiencies, a recursive approach can be used for Floyd-Warshall by incrementally adding intermediate vertices and updating the shortest paths matrix. This method breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, each addressing an additional layer of intermediates until all are considered.

QUESTION: True or False: Consider a network of processes based on an arbitrary undirected graph G = (V, E) with a distinguished vertex $v_0 \in V$. The process at each vertex $v \in V$ starts with a positive integer $x_v$. The goal is for the process at $v_0$ to compute the maximum $max_{v \in V} x_v$. There is an asynchronous distributed algorithm that solves this problem using $O(diam^2d)$ time and $O(|E| + diam \cdot n)$ messages.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**. 

In asynchronous distributed systems, algorithms like max-gossip can efficiently compute the maximum value across a network. The given complexities align with such algorithms: O(diam²n) for time and O(|E| + diam·n) for messages are achievable, ensuring v0 computes the global maximum correctly.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose a file server stores a hash of every file in addition to the file contents. When you download a file from the server, you also download the hash and confirm that it matches the file. This system securely verifies that the downloaded file has not been modified by an adversary, provided the hash function has collision resistance.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. Using both the file content and its hash allows for secure verification of file integrity due to collision resistance, ensuring that any modification would change the hash, thus confirming authenticity.

**Answer:**  
True. The system securely verifies the downloaded file's integrity because collision-resistant hashes detect any alterations, ensuring unmodified files are confirmed.

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose Alice, Bob, and Charlie secretly generate a, b and c, respectively, and publish $g^a \mod p, g^b \mod p$, and $g^c \mod p$, where p is a prime. Then, Alice, Bob, and Charles can each compute $g^{abc} \mod p$ as a shared secret known only to the three of them.
//// ANSWER: 
The answer is **True**. Each party can compute \( g^{abc} \) using their own exponent and the others' public values through a series of modular exponentiations.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Each party computes an intermediate value:**
   - Alice computes \( (g^b)^a = g^{ab} \).
   - Bob computes \( (g^a)^b = g^{ab} \).
   - Charlie computes \( (g^a)^c = g^{ac} \) or another similar step.

2. **Combine with the third party's value:**
   - Alice takes her intermediate value and raises it to the power of c: \( (g^{ab})^c = g^{abc} \).
   - Similarly, Bob can take his intermediate value and raise it to a higher power using Charlie's value.
   
3. **Resulting in the desired exponentiation:**
   - All parties end up with \( g^{abc} \) through their respective computations.

Thus, each participant successfully computes \( g^{abc} \) without revealing their private exponents.

QUESTION: True or False: The number of memory transfers used by the best cache-oblivious algorithm is always at least the number of memory transfers used by the best external-memory algorithm for the same problem.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The number of memory transfers used by the best cache-oblivious algorithm does not always exceed that of the best external-memory algorithm for the same problem. In fact, external-memory algorithms are specifically designed to minimize I/O operations and can often achieve fewer memory transfers compared to cache-oblivious algorithms when dealing with problems where such optimization is possible.

**Answer:**  
False. The best external-memory algorithm can sometimes use fewer memory transfers than the best cache-oblivious algorithm for certain problems.

QUESTION: True or False: If there is a time-optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm for a problem, then that algorithm is also optimal with respect to memory transfers in the cache-oblivious model.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. 

A time-optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm does not necessarily translate to being optimal in terms of memory transfers within the cache-oblivious model. While both optimizations aim for efficiency, they focus on different aspects: time complexity and spatial locality (cache efficiency). An algorithm optimized for minimal time may not be designed with optimal memory access patterns required by the cache-oblivious model. Therefore, it's possible that a time-optimal algorithm is not necessarily cache-efficient in this context.

QUESTION: What extra information needs to be stored at each node? Describe how to answer an AVERAGE(x) query in $O(lg n)$ time using this extra information.
//// ANSWER: 
To efficiently answer an `AVERAGE(x)` query using a segment tree, each node must store two pieces of information:

1. **Sum**: The total sum of the elements within the segment represented by the node.
2. **Count**: The number of elements (or length) of the segment.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Segment Tree Structure**: Each node in the segment tree represents a specific segment of the array. For example, a leaf node corresponds to a single element, while an internal node covers a range of elements.

- **Storing Sum and Count**:
  - At each node, store the sum of all elements within its segment.
  - Also, store the count of elements in that segment (which is equal to the length of the segment).

### Query Process for Average:

1. **Traversal**: Traverse the segment tree while covering the query range [l, r].
2. **Accumulating Values**:
   - For each node whose entire segment lies within [l, r], add its sum and count to running totals.
3. **Compute Average**: After collecting all relevant sums and counts, compute the average as `total_sum / total_count`.

This approach ensures that each query is processed in O(log n) time, leveraging the precomputed sum and count at each node.

### Example:

Suppose we have an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` represented by a segment tree. Each internal node will store both the sum of its elements and their count.

- Leaf nodes: Store individual elements (sum) and count `1`.
- Parent nodes: For example, the parent covering [1, 2] stores sum `3` and count `2`.

For an average query on the entire array:
- Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
- Count = 4
- Average = 10 / 4 = 2.5

This method efficiently computes the desired result by aggregating precomputed values, ensuring optimal performance for large datasets.

QUESTION: Describe how to modify INSERT to maintain this information. Briefly justify that the worst-case running time for INSERT remains O(lgn).
//// ANSWER: 
To ensure that the worst-case running time for insertion in a binary search tree (BST) remains O(log n), we can modify the insertion process by incorporating techniques that maintain the balance of the tree. Two common approaches are using an AVL Tree or a Red-Black Tree.

### AVL Tree:
1. **Balance Factor**: Each node maintains a balance factor, which is the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees.
2. **Insertion Process**:
   - Perform standard BST insertion to add the new node.
   - After insertion, update the height of all ancestors up to the root.
   - Check if any ancestor has an invalid balance factor (greater than 1 or less than -1).
3. **Rebalancing**: If a node becomes unbalanced, perform one of four rotations (left-left, left-right, right-right, right-left) to restore balance.

### Red-Black Tree:
1. **Coloring**: Each node is colored either red or black.
2. **Insertion Process**:
   - Perform standard BST insertion and color the new node as red.
   - Update the parent's color if necessary based on specific rules.
3. **Rebalancing**: After inserting a red node, check for violations of Red-Black tree properties (e.g., two consecutive red nodes). If violations occur, perform rotations or recoloring to restore balance.

### Why It Works:
Both structures ensure that the height of the tree remains logarithmic in the number of nodes. AVL Trees use precise balance factors and rotations, while Red-Black Trees rely on coloring and specific rules to maintain balance. These modifications do not change the asymptotic complexity but ensure that insertions remain efficient even as the tree grows.

By using these self-balancing techniques, the worst-case running time for each insertion operation remains O(log n).

QUESTION: Suppose we send Forrest k reminders for each of n events. What is the expected number of appointments Forrest will remember? Give your answer in terms of k and n.
//// ANSWER: 
The expected number of remembered appointments for Forrest across all events can be calculated by considering each event individually. For each event, with k reminders sent out, the probability that at least one reminder leads to an appointment is 1 - (1 - p)^k, where p is the probability of remembering a single reminder. Therefore, multiplying this probability by the number of events n gives the overall expected value.

Answer: The expected number of remembered appointments is n multiplied by [1 minus (1 minus p) raised to the power of k], which can be expressed as:

E = n * [1 - (1 - p)^k]

QUESTION: Suppose we send Forrest k reminders for a single event. How should we set k with respect to n so that Forrest will remember the event with high probability, i.e., 1 – 1/nº?
//// ANSWER: 
To determine how Forrest should set the number of reminders \( k \) relative to the number of days until an event (\( n \)) so that he remembers the event with high probability (e.g., approaching 1), we can analyze the problem using probabilistic principles.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Probability of Remembering**: The probability that Forrest remembers the event at least once after \( k \) reminders is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - (1 - p)^k
   \]
   where \( p \) is the probability of remembering on a single reminder.

2. **Independent Events**: Assuming each reminder is an independent event, we want to ensure that \( (1 - p)^k \) is very small, making \( P \) close to 1.

3. **Modeling Reminder Success Probability**:
   - If each reminder's success probability decreases over time, e.g., exponentially or linearly, the analysis becomes more complex.
   - Without specific information on how \( p \) varies with days before the event, we can consider a uniform approach where each day has an equal chance of being reminded.

4. **Approximation Using Poisson Distribution**:
   - For small probabilities, the Poisson approximation can be used: if each reminder has probability \( \lambda / n \), then after \( k = \lambda n \) reminders, the probability approaches:
     \[
     P \approx 1 - e^{-\lambda}
     \]
   - To achieve high confidence (e.g., approaching certainty as \( \lambda \) increases), Forrest should set \( k \) proportional to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
Forrest should set \( k \) such that it is a multiple of \( n \). Specifically, if each day's reminder has an equal probability \( p \), then setting \( k = c \cdot n \) (where \( c \) is a constant greater than 1) ensures high probability of remembering the event. A common choice is to set \( k \) proportional to \( n \ln(n) \) for higher confidence, but this can vary based on individual behavior and reminder frequency.

**Answer**: Forrest should set \( k \) as a multiple of \( n \), such as \( k = c \cdot n \) where \( c > 1 \), ensuring high probability of remembering the event.

QUESTION: Suppose we send Forrest k reminders for each of n events. How should we set k with respect to n so that Forrest will remember all the events with high probability, i.e., 1 – 1/nº?
//// ANSWER: 
To ensure Forrest remembers all events with high probability (at least \(1 - \frac{1}{n^c}\)), we need to determine the number of reminders (\(k\)) per event. 

**Answer:**
For each event, Forrest should receive approximately \(k = \Theta(\ln n)\) reminders when each reminder has a constant success probability less than 1.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

1. **Modeling the Problem:**
   - Each event requires at least one successful reminder to be remembered.
   - For each event, there are \(k\) independent trials (reminders), each with success probability \(p\).
   - We want the probability that all events are remembered to be at least \(1 - \frac{1}{n^c}\).

2. **Probability of Missing an Event:**
   - The probability that a single reminder fails is \(1 - p\).
   - For \(k\) reminders, the probability that none succeed (i.e., missing the event) is \((1 - p)^k\).

3. **Union Bound for All Events:**
   - There are \(n\) events; using the union bound, the probability of missing at least one event is:
     \[
     n \times (1 - p)^k
     \]
   - We want this to be ≤ \(\frac{1}{n^c}\):
     \[
     n(1 - p)^k \leq \frac{1}{n^c}
     \]

4. **Solving for \(k\):**
   - Rearrange the inequality:
     \[
     (1 - p)^k \leq \frac{1}{n^{c+1}}
     \]
   - Take natural logarithm on both sides:
     \[
     k \ln(1 - p) \leq -(c + 1)\ln(n)
     \]
   - Since \(p\) is small, approximate \(\ln(1 - p) \approx -p\):
     \[
     k p \geq (c + 1)\ln(n)
     \]
   - Solve for \(k\):
     \[
     k \geq \frac{(c + 1)\ln(n)}{p}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To achieve the desired probability, set:
     \[
     k = \Theta\left(\frac{\ln n}{p}\right)
     \]
   - If \(p\) is a constant (e.g., \(0.95\)), then \(k\) should grow proportionally to \(\ln n\).

**Final Answer:**
For each event, Forrest needs approximately \(k = \Theta(\ln n)\) reminders when each reminder has a fixed success probability less than 1.

$\boxed{k = \Theta(\ln n)}$

QUESTION: True or False: Using similar techniques used in Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's running time can be improved to O(Vlog2 7).
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm's running time cannot be improved using techniques similar to those in Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm.

**Explanation:**

1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: It operates on graphs and finds all-pairs shortest paths, with a standard time complexity of O(V³). This is achieved through dynamic programming by considering each vertex as an intermediate step.

2. **Strassen's Algorithm**: Specifically designed for matrix multiplication, it reduces the number of multiplications needed, lowering the exponent from n³ to approximately n².⁶⁸¹ using divide-and-conquer techniques.

3. **Inapplicable Techniques**: Since Floyd-Warshall deals with graph theory and dynamic programming rather than numerical linear algebra (matrix operations), applying Strassen's methods is not feasible. The algorithm doesn't involve matrix multiplication, so its optimizations are unrelated to those used in Strassen's approach.

4. **Optimizations for Floyd-Warshall**: While there have been some improvements over the years, none have brought the time complexity down to O(V log V) or similar. The best-known lower bounds suggest that O(V³) is near-optimal for dense graphs.

Thus, using Strassen-like optimizations isn't applicable here, making the original assertion false.

QUESTION: True or False: For graphs G = (V, E) where E = O(V1.5), Johnson's algorithm is asymptotically faster than Floyd-Warshall.
//// ANSWER: 
For graphs where the number of edges \( E \) is \( O(V^{1.5}) \), Johnson's algorithm is indeed asymptotically faster than Floyd-Warshall.

**Answer: True**

**Explanation:**
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** This algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(V^3) \). It is suitable for dense graphs where the number of edges is close to \( V^2 \).
  
- **Johnson's Algorithm:** Johnson's algorithm, on the other hand, uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a heap and has a time complexity of \( O(V^2 \log V) \), making it more efficient for sparse graphs.

For graphs where \( E = O(V^{1.5}) \), which are considered sparse (since they have fewer edges than a complete graph), Johnson's algorithm outperforms Floyd-Warshall asymptotically because its time complexity grows slower with respect to the number of vertices \( V \).

QUESTION: True or False: Consider the directed graph where each vertex represents a subproblem in a dynamic program, and there is an edge from p to q if and only if subproblem p depends on (recursively calls) subproblem q. Then this graph is a directed rooted tree.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

In dynamic programming, while each subproblem can be represented as a node and dependencies as edges, these edges do not form a simple directed rooted tree. Instead, the graph can have nodes that depend on multiple other subproblems, resulting in nodes with multiple parents. This structure forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) rather than a rooted tree because nodes may have more than one incoming edge.

Answer:  
The statement is false; the dependency graph isn't necessarily a rooted tree due to possible multiple dependencies per node.

QUESTION: True or False: In a connected, weighted graph, every lowest weight edge is always in some minimum spanning tree.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. In a connected, weighted graph, every edge with the absolute minimum weight will always be included in at least one of the graph's minimum spanning trees (MSTs). This is because Kruskal's algorithm prioritizes adding edges from the lowest to highest weights without forming cycles. Since these minimal-weight edges are the smallest available, they must be included first to ensure that all vertices remain connected with the smallest possible total edge weight.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: For a connected, weighted graph with n vertices and exactly n edges, it is possible to find a minimum spanning tree in O(n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The question is about determining whether it's possible to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a connected, weighted graph with \( n \) vertices and exactly \( n \) edges in \( O(n) \) time.

1. **Graph Structure**: A connected graph with \( n \) vertices must have at least \( n-1 \) edges for connectivity. With \( n \) edges, the graph is unicyclic (contains exactly one cycle).

2. **MST Construction**: For a unicyclic graph, the MST can be obtained by removing one edge from the single cycle present in the graph.

3. **Algorithm Considerations**:
   - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Typically has \( O(E \log E) \) time complexity due to sorting edges. Here, \( E = n \), leading to \( O(n \log n) \).
   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Generally \( O(V^2) \) or \( O(E + V \log V) \) with a priority queue, which is also \( O(n \log n) \).

4. **Exploiting Unicyclic Structure**:
   - Detecting the cycle can be done efficiently using BFS/DFS in linear time (\( O(n) \)).
   - Once the cycle is detected, identifying and removing one edge from it suffices to form the MST.

5. **Conclusion**: While standard algorithms like Krusky's and Prim's have higher complexities for general graphs, the specific structure of a unicyclic graph allows for an optimized approach that can potentially run in \( O(n) \) time by leveraging cycle detection without processing all edges fully.

**Answer**: True. It is possible to find the MST in \( O(n) \) time by detecting and removing one edge from the single cycle, utilizing the unicyclic graph structure for an optimized approach.

QUESTION: True or False: For a flow network with an integer capacity on every edge, the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm runs in time O((V + E) |f|) where |f| is the maximum flow.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. When dealing with a network where all edge capacities are integers, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, regardless of the specific strategy used to select augmenting paths, will terminate in O((V + E)|f|) time, where |f| is the maximum flow value.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Algorithm:**
   - The Ford-Fulkerson method works by iteratively finding augmenting paths in the residual graph and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths exist.
   - Each augmentation increases the total flow by at least 1 unit when all capacities are integers.

2. **Role of Integer Capacities:**
   - With integer capacities, each augmenting path can carry an amount of flow that is a positive integer (specifically, the minimum residual capacity along the path).
   - This ensures that after each augmentation, the total flow increases by at least 1 unit.

3. **Bounding the Number of Augmentations:**
   - Since the maximum possible flow |f| is fixed and each step contributes at least 1 to this value, the number of necessary augmentations cannot exceed |f|.
   
4. **Time Complexity per Augmentation:**
   - Finding an augmenting path in the residual graph can be done using either BFS or DFS, both of which take O(V + E) time.
   - Therefore, each augmentation step is bounded by O(V + E).

5. **Total Time Complexity:**
   - Multiplying the number of augmentations (bounded by |f|) with the time per augmentation gives a total complexity of O((V + E)|f|).
   
6. **Conclusion:**
   - The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, when applied to networks with integer capacities and using any method to select augmenting paths, will indeed terminate in O((V + E)|f|) time.

**Answer:**  
True. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm has a time complexity of O((V+E)|f|) when all edge capacities are integers.

QUESTION: True or False: Let C = (S, V \ S) be a minimum cut in a flow network. If we strictly increase the capacity of every edge across C, then the maximum flow of the network must increase.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**. 

Here's why: According to the max-flow min-cut theorem, the value of the maximum flow equals the capacity of the minimum cut. If we strictly increase each edge's capacity across a minimum cut C, the total capacity of C increases. Since any augmenting path from source to sink must cross at least one edge in C, increasing these capacities allows more flow through the network. Therefore, the new maximum flow will be higher than before.

Answer: **True**

QUESTION: True or False: Every linear program has a unique optimal solution.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement "Every linear program has a unique optimal solution" is **False**. 

Linear programs can have multiple optimal solutions if the objective function's level sets touch an edge or face of the feasible region, resulting in infinitely many optimal points. Additionally, unbounded feasible regions may not have an optimal solution at all unless properly bounded.

Answer: False

QUESTION: True or False: 3SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time, even if P = NP.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. 

If P equals NP, it implies that all problems in NP, including 3SAT, can be solved in polynomial time. Therefore, under the condition P=NP, 3SAT can indeed be solved efficiently.

QUESTION: Repeatedly selecting a vertex of maximum degree, and deleting the incident edges, is a 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover.
//// ANSWER: 
The problem involves finding a vertex cover in a graph using a greedy algorithm, which selects vertices based on their current maximum degree. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Vertex Cover Definition**: A set of vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in this set.

2. **Greedy Algorithm Approach**:
   - Repeatedly select the vertex with the highest remaining degree.
   - Add this vertex to the cover and remove all its incident edges from consideration.

3. **Approximation Factor**: The greedy algorithm provides a solution that is within twice the size of the optimal vertex cover. This means if the minimum vertex cover has size `k`, the greedy approach will find a cover of size at most `2k`.

4. **Example Application**:
   - Consider a square graph (A-B-C-D-A) where each vertex has degree 2.
   - The optimal vertex cover is two vertices, e.g., B and D or A and C.
   - Applying the greedy algorithm: picking A first covers edges AB and AD. Then, pick C as it still has the highest remaining degree, covering BC and CD. This results in a cover of size 2, which matches the optimal.

5. **Conclusion**: The greedy approach efficiently finds a vertex cover with a performance guarantee, ensuring its size is no more than twice that of the minimum possible.

**Answer**:  
The system uses a greedy algorithm to find a vertex cover by repeatedly selecting the vertex with the highest remaining degree until all edges are covered. This method guarantees that the solution will be at most twice as large as the optimal vertex cover. Therefore, the size of the vertex cover found is \boxed{2} times the minimum possible.

QUESTION: Draw the shortest path from Boston to New York in the following graph if m = ∞. Charging stations are marked as circles.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the shortest path from Boston to New York in a graph where \( m = \infty \) and charging stations are marked as circles, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Understanding \( m = \infty \):** This means there is no limit on the resource (e.g., fuel) consumption between refills. Therefore, any path from Boston to New York is permissible.

2. **Role of Charging Stations:** Since charging stations allow resetting the resource without penalty, they can be used as waypoints. However, with \( m = \infty \), these stations do not affect the shortest path calculation because there are no constraints on resource usage.

3. **Graph Structure Consideration:** Without a visual graph, we assume that Boston and New York are connected through intermediate nodes (possibly including charging stations). The shortest path would be the one with the fewest edges or minimal distance.

4. **Conclusion:** Given \( m = \infty \), any path from Boston to New York is valid. The shortest path is determined by minimizing the number of steps or edges in the graph.

**Answer:**  
The shortest path from Boston to New York, given \( m = \infty \) and considering charging stations as waypoints without resource constraints, is the minimal path with the fewest edges connecting these two points in the graph.

QUESTION: Draw the shortest path from Boston to New York in the following (identical) graph if m = 100.
//// ANSWER: 
The shortest path from Boston to New York in the given graph depends on whether there's a direct connection between them.

1. **Direct Connection**: If there's an edge directly connecting Boston to New York, this is the shortest path with a total weight of 1.

2. **Indirect Path**: If no direct edge exists, find the minimal number of edges (steps) required to reach from Boston to New York. For example:
   - Boston -> City A -> New York: Total weight = 2.
   - Boston -> City B -> City C -> New York: Total weight = 3.

**Conclusion**: The shortest path is either the direct edge (if exists) or a multi-edge route with the least number of steps, ensuring the total weight equals the number of edges in the path.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to solve the problem. For full credit, your algorithm should run in O(VE + V2 log V) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The problem you're referring to is likely finding single-source shortest paths in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The appropriate algorithm for this task is **Johnson's Algorithm**, which efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity of O(VE + V² log V).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Problem Identification**: The goal is to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph where edge weights are non-negative.

2. **Algorithm Selection**: Johnson's Algorithm is chosen because it efficiently handles graphs with non-negative edge weights and provides the desired time complexity.

3. **Steps of Johnson's Algorithm**:
   - **Step 1**: Add a new vertex to the graph and connect it to all other vertices with zero-weight edges.
   - **Step 2**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from this new vertex to all others, which helps in reweighting the original graph.
   - **Step 3**: Remove the added vertex and adjust edge weights using the results from Dijkstra's step.
   - **Step 4**: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm on each vertex (excluding the removed one) with the adjusted weights to find shortest paths.

This approach ensures that we leverage the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm within an overall framework suitable for Johnson's time complexity.

QUESTION: Give a greedy algorithm that outputs an ordering of the psets that minimizes the total penalty for all the psets. Analyze the running time and prove correctness.
//// ANSWER: 
The greedy algorithm that sorts the psets in increasing order of their due dates ensures that all psets are completed before their respective deadlines if possible. This approach minimizes the total penalty by prioritizing those with earlier deadlines, thereby reducing the likelihood of missing any deadlines and incurring penalties.

**Answer:**

To solve the problem of ordering psets to minimize the total penalty, we can use a greedy algorithm based on the following steps:

1. **Sort the psets:** Arrange all psets in increasing order of their due dates.
2. **Process each pset in this sorted list:** For each pset, check if it can be completed before its deadline without violating any previous constraints.

**Analysis:**

- **Running Time:** The algorithm involves sorting the psets, which takes \( O(n \log n) \) time using efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort. Processing each pset is a linear operation, so the overall complexity remains dominated by the sorting step, resulting in an \( O(n \log n) \) running time.

- **Correctness:** The algorithm ensures that as many psets as possible are completed before their deadlines. By prioritizing psets with earlier deadlines first, we minimize the total penalty because completing these on time allows more flexibility for subsequent psets with later deadlines to also be completed without incurring penalties.

This approach is optimal and provides a minimal total penalty by making locally optimal choices at each step, which contribute to a globally optimal solution.

QUESTION: First look at the special case where the maze is just a single path of length |E| from s to t, and all the edges have capacity 1 (see below). Exactly how many nights are required for the teens to escape?
//// ANSWER: 
The maze consists of a single straight path from start (s) to finish (t), with each edge having a capacity of 1. Since each edge can only be traversed once per night and the teens must follow this single path step by step without any shortcuts or branches, they will need exactly |E| nights to escape.

**Answer:** Exactly |E| nights are required for the teens to escape.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of nights to escape, by making calls to the magic algorithm. Analyze your time complexity in terms of V, E, m, a, and T(V, E, m).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the minimum number of nights required to escape using a magic algorithm, we can model the problem as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how:

1. **Modeling the Problem**: Represent the scenario as a graph where nodes correspond to positions and edges represent possible moves between them.

2. **Algorithm Selection**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) since it efficiently finds the shortest path in terms of edge count, which directly translates to the number of nights needed if each move takes one night.

3. **Time Complexity Analysis**:
   - The standard BFS algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(V + E) \), where \( V \) is the number of vertices (positions) and \( E \) is the number of edges (possible moves).
   - If "m" represents additional constraints or parameters affecting each call, such as parallelism, the total time could be adjusted. For example, if each magic call can process multiple edges simultaneously, the complexity might be reduced by a factor related to m.

**Conclusion**: The algorithm is BFS, which calculates the minimum number of nights needed. Each call corresponds to moving one step, so the number of calls equals the depth of the shortest path. The time complexity in terms of V and E would typically be \( O(V + E) \), adjusted for any additional parameters like m if applicable.

Answer: The algorithm is BFS with a time complexity of \( T(V,E,m) = O(m(V + E)) \).

QUESTION: Now give the “magic” algorithm, and analyze its time complexity.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the time complexity of the "magic" algorithm, we first need a clear understanding of which specific algorithm is being referred to. Since the user did not specify any particular algorithm, such as linear search, binary search, quicksort, or another method, it's impossible to provide an accurate analysis without additional details.

If you can clarify which algorithm you're interested in analyzing, I'd be happy to help break down its time complexity step by step.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to find a driver assignment di ∈ Si for each day i such that no person j has to drive more than their limit lj. (The algorithm should output “no” if there is no such assignment.)
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of assigning drivers to each day without exceeding their limits, follow these steps:

1. **Model as a Bipartite Graph**:
   - Create a bipartite graph with two sets: one for days (i) and one for drivers (j).
   - Draw an edge from day i to driver j if driver j is available for day i (i.e., j ∈ S_i).

2. **Construct a Flow Network**:
   - Introduce a source node connected to all day nodes with edges of capacity 1.
   - Connect each driver node to the sink with an edge whose capacity equals their driving limit l_j.

3. **Set Edge Capacities Between Drivers and Days**:
   - For each available connection between a driver j and a day i, set the edge capacity to infinity or a sufficiently large number (practically, 1 since each day needs exactly one driver).

4. **Compute Maximum Flow**:
   - Use a max-flow algorithm (like Dinic's or Ford-Fulkerson) to compute the maximum flow from source to sink.

5. **Determine Feasibility and Assignment**:
   - If the maximum flow equals the number of days, an assignment exists.
   - Trace back the augmenting paths in the residual network to determine which drivers are assigned to which days.

This approach ensures that each day is assigned exactly one driver within their limit, using a max-flow framework.

QUESTION: Give a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a directed graph G contains either a cycle or a Hamiltonian path (or both).
//// ANSWER: 
The topological sort of the given graph includes all nodes: [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5]. This indicates that the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), as all nodes are processed without any cycles.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Edges and In-Degrees**:
   - Node 1: outgoing to 3 → in_degree = 0
   - Node 2: outgoing to 3 → in_degree = 0
   - Node 4: outgoing to 5 → in_degree = 0
   - Node 6: no outgoing edges → in_degree = 0

2. **Initialize Queue with Nodes of In-Degree Zero**:
   - Start with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.

3. **Process Each Node**:
   - Process node 1: reduce the in-degree of its neighbor (node 3) by 1.
   - Process node 2: further reduce node 3's in-degree to zero.
   - Process node 4: reduce node 5's in-degree from 1 to 0.
   - Process node 6: no effect on others.

4. **Update and Re-queue Nodes with Zero In-Degree**:
   - After processing nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6, nodes 3 and 5 now have zero in-degrees.
   - Add them to the queue for processing.

5. **Final Processing of Nodes 3 and 5**:
   - Process node 3: no outgoing edges.
   - Process node 5: no outgoing edges.

6. **Resulting Topological Order**:
   - The order is [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5], ensuring all nodes are included and respecting the dependencies (edges).

Answer: The topological sort includes all six nodes as shown in the step-by-step explanation above.

$\boxed{[1,\ 2,\ 4,\ 6,\ 3,\ 5]}$

QUESTION: Show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a directed graph G' contains both a cycle and a Hamiltonian Path, by giving a reduction from the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem: given a graph G, decide whether it has a Hamiltonian path. (Recall from recitation that the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem is NP-complete.)
//// ANSWER: 
Now, let's provide a step-by-step explanation based on this reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a graph \( G \) with a Hamiltonian path from vertex \( w_1 \) to vertex \( w_n \). We need to show that by adding two new vertices \( u \) and \( v \), along with appropriate edges, we can form a Hamiltonian cycle in the resulting graph \( G' \).

2. **Adding New Vertices**: Introduce two new vertices \( u \) and \( v \) into \( G \). Connect \( u \) to \( w_1 \) (i.e., add edge \( (u, w_1) \)) and connect \( v \) to \( w_n \) (i.e., add edge \( (v, w_n) \)).

3. **Forming the Cycle**: To create a cycle in \( G' \), we can use the existing Hamiltonian path from \( w_1 \) to \( w_n \). Start at vertex \( u \), traverse through \( w_1 \), then follow the original path up to \( w_n \), and finally connect back to \( v \).

4. **Connecting \( v \) Back to \( u \)**: To complete the cycle, add an edge between \( v \) and \( u \). This allows us to traverse from \( v \) directly back to \( u \), forming a closed loop.

5. **Resulting Cycle**: The path \( u \rightarrow w_1 \rightarrow w_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow w_n \rightarrow v \rightarrow u \) forms a Hamiltonian cycle in \( G' \).

6. **Conclusion**: By adding the two vertices and connecting them appropriately, we've transformed \( G \) into \( G' \), which now contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

Answer: 

By adding two new vertices \( u \) and \( v \) to graph \( G \) with edges \( (u, w_1) \) and \( (v, w_n) \), and connecting \( u \) and \( v \) with an edge, we form a Hamiltonian cycle in the resulting graph \( G' \). The cycle is constructed as \( u \rightarrow w_1 \rightarrow w_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow w_n \rightarrow v \rightarrow u \).

$\boxed{\text{G'}\text{ has a Hamiltonian cycle}}$

QUESTION: True or False: With all equal-sized intervals, a greedy algorithm based on earliest start time will always select the maximum number of compatible intervals.
//// ANSWER: 
The interval scheduling problem aims to select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals from a given set. When using a greedy algorithm that selects intervals based on their start times (earliest first), it does **not** always yield the optimal solution.

In some cases, selecting an earlier starting interval can block more opportunities for subsequent non-overlapping intervals, leading to fewer total selections than possible with a different selection strategy. For example:

- Intervals: [1,6], [2,3], [4,5]
  - Sorted by start time: [1,6] is selected first.
  - No further non-overlapping intervals can be chosen after that.
  - Total selected: 1
  - Optimal selection would have been to choose [2,3] and [4,5], totaling 2.

Thus, the greedy approach based on earliest start times does not guarantee an optimal solution for all cases. A better approach is to use a strategy based on earliest end times, which ensures optimality.

**Answer:**  
The interval scheduling problem's greedy algorithm selecting intervals by their start times (earliest first) does **not** always yield the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals. It fails in scenarios where an earlier start blocks more optimal selections later. Therefore, it is not always optimal.  

$\boxed{\text{No}}$

QUESTION: True or False: The problem of weighted interval scheduling can be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming.
//// ANSWER: 
The problem of weighted interval scheduling can indeed be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming after sorting the intervals by their end times.

**Answer:**
True. The problem can be solved efficiently using a dynamic programming approach with a time complexity of O(n log n). Here's how:

1. **Sorting:** First, sort all intervals based on their end times in increasing order.
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:** Define dp[i] as the maximum weight sum achievable considering the first i intervals.
3. **Binary Search:** For each interval i, use binary search to find the largest index j such that the end time of interval j is less than or equal to the start time of interval i.
4. **Recurrence Relation:** The recurrence relation becomes dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], weight(i) + dp[j]), where j is found using binary search.

This approach ensures each step after sorting is O(log n), leading to an overall O(n log n) time complexity.

QUESTION: True or False: If we divide an array into groups of 3, find the median of each group, recursively find the median of those medians, partition, and recurse, then we can obtain a linear-time median-finding algorithm.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. Dividing an array into groups of three to find the median recursively does not result in a linear-time algorithm. Instead, it leads to a higher time complexity due to less efficient partitioning compared to using larger group sizes like five.

**Explanation:**
1. **Median of Medians Approach:** This technique is used in algorithms like Quickselect to efficiently find the k-th smallest element.
2. **Group Size Impact:** Using groups of three may not ensure balanced partitions, leading to higher recursion depth and thus a time complexity worse than linear (e.g., O(n log n)).
3. **Efficiency with Larger Groups:** Groups of five or more are preferred because they provide better guarantees on partitioning, ensuring each step reduces the problem size sufficiently for linear time.

Therefore, dividing into groups of three does not yield a linear-time median-finding algorithm.

QUESTION: True or False: If we used the obvious Θ(n²) merge algorithm in the divide-and-conquer convex-hull algorithm, the overall time complexity would be O(n² log n).
//// ANSWER: 
The time complexity of this divide-and-conquer approach for computing convex hulls is determined by analyzing each recursive step. Each step involves splitting the set into two halves, computing their convex hulls (each taking O(k log k) where k = n/2), and merging them in linear time. This leads to a recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n). By Master Theorem case 2, this results in Θ(n log n).

Answer: The time complexity is $\boxed{O(n \log n)}$.

QUESTION: Van Emde Boas sort (where we insert all numbers, find the min, and then repeatedly call SUCCESSOR) can be used to sort n = lg u numbers in O(lg u·
//// ANSWER: 
Van Emde Boas (vEB) trees are a data structure designed for efficient operations on sets of integers, particularly useful when dealing with a universe of elements from 0 to \( u-1 \). They support insertion, finding the minimum element, and successor queries in \( O(\log u) \) amortized time.

When sorting \( n = \lg u \) numbers using a vEB tree:

1. **Insertion**: Each insertion operation takes \( O(\log u) \) time.
2. **Finding Minimum**: The minimum element can be retrieved in constant time, \( O(1) \).
3. **Successor Query**: Finding the next element (successor) also takes \( O(\log u) \) amortized time.

To sort \( n \) elements:
- Inserting all \( n \) elements into the vEB tree takes \( O(n \log u) \) time.
- Traversing from the minimum to collect all elements in sorted order involves \( n-1 \) successor operations, each taking \( O(\log u) \), resulting in an additional \( O(n \log u) \) time.

Thus, the total time complexity for sorting using a vEB tree is \( O(n \log u) \). Substituting \( n = \lg u \), the time complexity becomes \( O((\lg u)^2) \).

**Answer**: Yes, Van Emde Boas sort can be used to sort \( n = \lg u \) numbers in \( O(n \log u) \) time.

QUESTION: True or False: Van Emde Boas on n integers between 0 and u 1 supports successor queries in O(lg lg u) worst-case time using O(n) space.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**. The Van Emde Boas data structure supports successor and predecessor operations in O(log log u) worst-case time for n integers between 0 and u-1, utilizing O(n) space.

Answer:
True

QUESTION: True or False: In the potential method for amortized analysis, the potential energy should never go negative.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement that the potential energy should never go negative in the potential method for amortized analysis is **False**.

In the potential method, the potential function can fluctuate between positive and negative values as operations are performed. It serves as an abstract measure to balance costs across operations without imposing any restrictions on its sign. The key requirement is that the amortized cost remains non-negative over a sequence of operations, ensuring predictable performance analysis despite the potential function's variability.

Therefore, it's acceptable for the potential energy to be negative in certain scenarios, provided it doesn't cause the amortized cost to become negative and disrupt the overall analysis.

QUESTION: True or False: The quicksort algorithm that uses linear-time median finding to run in worst-case O(n log n) time requires O(n) auxiliary space.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The quicksort algorithm that uses linear-time median finding to achieve worst-case O(n log n) time complexity does not require O(n) auxiliary space. Instead, it maintains a lower auxiliary space requirement due to its balanced partitioning strategy.

**Answer:**

False. The quicksort algorithm using linear-time median finding for pivot selection requires O(log n) auxiliary space in the best case (balanced splits), rather than O(n).

QUESTION: True or False: Searching in a skip list takes O(log n) time with high probability, but could take Ω(2n) time with nonzero probability.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**. Searching in a skip list typically operates in O(log n) time with high probability due to its probabilistic balancing mechanism. However, there exists a negligible chance that the search could degrade to linear time, Ω(n), which can be expressed as Ω(2n) for asymptotic analysis purposes.

Answer:  
True

QUESTION: The following collection H = {h1,h2, h3} of hash functions is uni-versal, where each hash function maps the universe U = {A, B, C, D} of keys into the range {0, 1, 2} according to the following table:
//// ANSWER: 
The collection \( H = \{h_1, h_2, h_3\} \) is **not** universal because not every pair of keys collides with probability exactly \( \frac{1}{3} \). Specifically:

- The pairs (A,B), (A,C), and (B,D) never collide across any hash function in the collection.
- Therefore, their collision probability is 0, violating the universality condition.

Answer: No, the collection H is not universal.

QUESTION: Point out Ben's mistake in one sentence; no calculation needed. (Ben swears he has calculated FFT F and inverse FFT F-¹ correctly.)
//// ANSWER: 
Ben forgot to take the complex conjugate of one of the FFT results before element-wise multiplication with its inverse FFT result, which prevented the product from yielding a delta function as expected.

Answer: Ben did not take the complex conjugate of one of the FFTs before multiplying.

QUESTION: Give the fastest data structure you can for this problem, measured according to worst-case time.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the fastest data structure for a given problem based on worst-case time complexity, we need specific details about the operations required and any constraints. However, without knowing the exact problem, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.

If you could provide more context or clarify your problem, I would be happy to help identify the most appropriate data structure!

QUESTION: Design a data structure to maintain a set S of n distinct integers that supports the following two operations:
//// ANSWER: 
To maintain a set \( S \) of \( n \) distinct integers with efficient insertion and membership testing, we can use a **hash table** (or **dictionary**) as the underlying data structure. Here's how it works:

### Data Structure Selection
- **Hash Table**: A hash table provides an average time complexity of \( O(1) \) for both insertion and membership testing operations when using good collision resolution techniques.

### Operations

1. **Insertion**:
   - Compute the hash value of the integer to determine its position in the table.
   - If a collision occurs, use chaining or open addressing to handle it efficiently.

2. **Membership Testing**:
   - Compute the hash value of the integer to find its potential position.
   - Check if the corresponding bucket contains the integer.

### Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Both operations are average \( O(1) \), making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement with built-in data structures in most programming languages.

### Considerations
- **Hash Function**: A good hash function is crucial to minimize collisions and ensure efficient performance.
- **Collision Handling**: Techniques like chaining (using linked lists) or open addressing (linear probing) can be employed depending on the specific needs.

In conclusion, a hash table is an optimal choice for maintaining set \( S \) due to its efficiency in both insertion and membership testing operations.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n)-time randomized algorithm for testing whether p(x) · q(x) = r(x) that satisfies the following properties:
//// ANSWER: 
To determine if \( P(x) \cdot Q(x) = R(x) \) in linear time using a randomized algorithm:

1. **Choose Random Evaluation Points**: Select two distinct random points \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \).

2. **Evaluate Polynomials at These Points**:
   - Compute \( P(s_1) \), \( Q(s_1) \), and \( R(s_1) \).
   - Compute \( P(s_2) \), \( Q(s_2) \), and \( R(s_2) \).

3. **Check Product Equality at Each Point**:
   - Verify if \( P(s_1) \times Q(s_1) = R(s_1) \).
   - Verify if \( P(s_2) \times Q(s_2) = R(s_2) \).

4. **Decision Based on Checks**:
   - If both evaluations hold true, output "Yes".
   - If any evaluation fails, output "No".

This approach ensures an O(n)-time complexity since each polynomial evaluation at a point is linear in the number of coefficients, and we perform two such evaluations.

**Answer**: The randomized algorithm evaluates \( P(x) \), \( Q(x) \), and \( R(x) \) at two random points. If their products match at these points, it concludes that \( P(x) \cdot Q(x) = R(x) \); otherwise, it does not. This method runs in O(n) time as each evaluation is linear and only a constant number of evaluations are performed.

QUESTION: Prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 1.
//// ANSWER: 
To prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 1, we first need a clear understanding of what Property 1 encompasses. Assuming it refers to correctness—ensuring the algorithm produces the right output given valid inputs—we can structure the proof as follows:

### Proof Outline for Correctness:
1. **Define Correctness**: Clearly state what correctness means for your specific algorithm and problem.
2. **Algorithm Steps**: Detail each step of the algorithm, ensuring each maintains correctness.
3. **Mathematical or Inductive Proof**: Use induction or other methods to show the algorithm leads to the correct result.

### Example: Sorting Algorithm
- **Property 1**: The algorithm correctly sorts any input array.
- **Proof**:
  - Base Case: An empty list is trivially sorted.
  - Inductive Step: Assume a subarray of size n is sorted. Adding an element from position n+1, compare it with adjacent elements to maintain order.

This structured approach ensures the algorithm's correctness by methodically addressing each component and its contribution to achieving the desired outcome.

QUESTION: Prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 2.
//// ANSWER: 
To prove that our algorithm satisfies Property 2, we proceed as follows:

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

1. **Understanding Property 2:**  
   Assuming Property 2 pertains to the termination of the algorithm, we aim to demonstrate that under all possible inputs, the algorithm will halt after a finite number of steps.

2. **Algorithm Overview:**  
   The algorithm operates in iterative steps, processing elements until a specific condition is met. Each iteration involves updating variables and reducing a certain measure (e.g., error rate or distance).

3. **Termination Proof Structure:**  
   We employ the concept of potential functions to track progress. Define \( \Phi \) as a non-negative function that decreases with each iteration.

4. **Potential Function Analysis:**  
   - At each step, \( \Phi \) is updated based on algorithmic operations.
   - Since each update reduces \( \Phi \), and it's bounded below by zero, the number of iterations is finite.

5. **Base Cases and Termination Conditions:**  
   The algorithm includes inherent termination conditions (e.g., all elements processed or a target condition met). These ensure that no infinite loops occur.

6. **Conclusion on Property 2 Satisfaction:**  
   By ensuring \( \Phi \) decreases monotonically and is bounded below, the algorithm terminates after finite steps for any input. Thus, it satisfies Property 2 regarding termination.

**Final Statement:**
Our algorithm satisfies Property 2 by guaranteeing termination through a well-defined potential function that ensures progress towards halting under all inputs.

QUESTION: Design a randomized algorithm to check whether p(x) · q(x) = r(x) that is correct with probability at least 1 ε. Analyze your algorithm in terms of n and 1/ε.
//// ANSWER: 
The randomized algorithm to verify whether \( p(x) \cdot q(x) = r(x) \) with probability at least \( 1 - \epsilon \) involves evaluating a single point in an appropriately chosen finite field. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

**Algorithm:**
1. **Choose a prime number \( p \):** Select a prime \( p > \frac{2n}{\epsilon} \), ensuring that the probability of a non-zero polynomial evaluating to zero at a random point is less than \( \epsilon \).
   
2. **Select a random evaluation point:** Pick a random integer \( a \) from the set \( \{0, 1, ..., p-1\} \).

3. **Evaluate both sides at \( a \):** Compute:
   - \( p(a) \mod p \)
   - \( q(a) \mod p \)
   - Multiply these results to get \( (p(a) \cdot q(a)) \mod p \).
   - Subtract \( r(a) \mod p \) from this product.

4. **Check the result:** If the result is zero modulo \( p \), output that \( p(x) \cdot q(x) = r(x) \). Otherwise, output that they are not equal.

**Time Complexity:**
- The algorithm runs in \( O(n) \) time because evaluating each polynomial at a single point takes linear time relative to the degree of the polynomials. 

This approach leverages properties from finite field theory and probabilistic checking to efficiently verify polynomial multiplication with high confidence.

QUESTION: Define TLij to be maximum tastiness value in the top-left quadrant of cell (i, j): TLi,j = max{Ta,b | 1 ≤ a ≤ i, 1 ≤ b ≤ j}. Find a dynamic programming algorithm to compute TLi,j, for all 1 < i < n and 1 < j < m, in O(nm) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum value present in any submatrix of a given matrix `T`. Since each element can be considered as a 1x1 submatrix, our task simplifies to finding the maximum value among all elements in the matrix.

### Approach
The approach involves iterating through each row and then each element within that row. By keeping track of the maximum value encountered during this iteration, we can efficiently determine the highest value present in the matrix. This method ensures that we only traverse the matrix once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.

### Solution Code
```python
def maximal_submatrix_value(T):
    if not T:
        return None
    max_val = -float('inf')
    for row in T:
        current_max = -float('inf')
        for num in row:
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
    return max_val
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We start by checking if the matrix `T` is empty. If it is, we return `None`.
2. **Iterate Through Rows and Elements**: For each element in every row of the matrix, we compare it with the current maximum value.
3. **Update Maximum Value**: If an element is greater than the current maximum, we update our maximum value.
4. **Return Result**: After traversing all elements, the maximum value found is returned.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum value by leveraging a single traversal of the matrix, ensuring optimal performance even for larger matrices.

QUESTION: Use the idea in part (a) to obtain an O(nm) algorithm to find the tastiest dish.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve the problem of finding the tastiest dish efficiently with an O(nm) algorithm, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where each step builds upon previous computations in linear time relative to n and m.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** We need to determine which combination of ingredients yields the tastiest dish. Each dish is composed by selecting one ingredient from each category (e.g., flavor, texture), leading to a grid where rows represent categories and columns represent specific choices within those categories.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:** Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum tastiness score achievable by considering the first i categories up to the j-th choice in that category.

3. **Transition Function:** For each category i, iterate through all possible choices j (1 ≤ j ≤ m). The value of `dp[i][j]` is computed based on the best score from either continuing without changing the current choice or switching to a new one:
   ```
   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + tastiness(i, j)) for all k in 1..m
   ```

4. **Initialization:** Set `dp[0][0]` as the base case with zero tastiness.

5. **Result Extraction:** The maximum value across all `dp[n][j]` gives the tastiest dish's score.

6. **Time Complexity:** Each of the n categories requires m operations, leading to an overall O(nm) time complexity.

**Answer:**

By using dynamic programming, we can efficiently compute the tastiest dish in O(nm) time by iteratively building up solutions for each category and choice combination, ensuring optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems are addressed.

QUESTION: Give a naïve algorithm running in O(m + n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
A common example of an algorithm with a time complexity of O(m + n) is Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's why:

1. **Time Complexity**: BFS processes each vertex once, contributing O(n), and each edge once, contributing O(m). Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m + n).

2. **Algorithm Description**:
   - **Initialization**: Start with a queue containing the initial node.
   - **Traversal**: Dequeue a node, process it (mark as visited), then enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.
   - **Termination**: Continue until the queue is empty.

3. **Naïveté**: BFS is considered naïve because it's simple to implement and understand without requiring complex data structures like priority queues or disjoint sets.

In summary, BFS is a straightforward algorithm that fits the O(m + n) time complexity description due to its linear processing of nodes and edges.

QUESTION: If m = n, give an algorithm that runs in O(lgn) time.
//// ANSWER: 
When \( m = n \), an efficient algorithm can often leverage techniques like binary search or divide-and-conquer strategies to achieve \( O(\log n) \) time complexity. For instance, if you're searching for an element in one of two sorted arrays of equal length, a modified binary search approach that traverses both arrays simultaneously can yield the desired efficiency.

**Algorithm: Two Sorted Arrays Search**

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set pointers \( i \) and \( j \) to 0 for array A and B respectively.
2. **Binary Search on One Array**: Perform a binary search on one of the arrays (e.g., array A). For each midpoint, compare elements in both arrays.
3. **Adjust Pointers Based on Comparison**:
   - If \( A[i] < B[j] \), increment \( i \).
   - If \( A[i] > B[j] \), increment \( j \).
   - If equal, record the element and adjust pointers to continue searching in both arrays.
4. **Terminate**: Stop when either pointer reaches the end of its array.

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space by comparing elements from both arrays without nested loops, ensuring an average time complexity of \( O(\log n) \).

**Conclusion:** Yes, when \( m = n \), algorithms like modified binary search can achieve \( O(\log n) \) time complexity for specific problems involving two sorted arrays.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm that runs in O(lg(min{m, n})) time, for any m and n.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm you're looking for is one that efficiently finds the k-th smallest element in two sorted arrays. Here's how it works:

1. **Binary Search on Smaller Array**: Perform binary search on the smaller of the two arrays (let's say array A with size m) to find a pivot point.
2. **Compare Pivot Elements**: Compare the element at this pivot position in both arrays. If all elements before the pivot in one array are less than or equal to those in the other, it indicates that we've found the k-th smallest element.
3. **Adjust Search Space**: If the element in array A is smaller, adjust the search space in array B to exclude the first part of it. Conversely, if the element in array B is smaller, adjust the search space in array A.

This approach ensures that each step reduces the problem size by half, leading to a time complexity of O(log(min{m,n})).

**Answer**: The algorithm efficiently finds the k-th smallest element in two sorted arrays using binary search on the smaller dimension, achieving an O(log(min{m,n})) time complexity.

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose algorithm A has two steps, and A succeeds if both the steps succeed. If the two steps succeed with probability $p_1$ and $p_2$ respectively, then A succeeds with probability $p_1p_2$.
//// ANSWER: 
The success probability of Algorithm A depends on whether the two steps are independent. If they are independent, then yes, the total success probability is \( p_1 \times p_2 \). However, if the steps are dependent (e.g., Step 2's success depends on Step 1), this formula doesn't apply directly and requires knowing the conditional probabilities.

**Answer:** False. The statement is only true if the two steps are independent; otherwise, it may not hold.

QUESTION: True or False: If the divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm (from Lecture 2) used a $\Theta(n^2)$ strategy to discover the maximum and minimum tangents, the overall algorithm would run in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
//// ANSWER: 
The divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm typically runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time. However, if during the merge step a brute-force (quadratic) method is used instead of the efficient linear approach, the overall complexity increases to \(O(n^2 \log n)\).

**Answer:** The time complexity becomes \(O(n^2 \log n)\).  
So, the final answer is \boxed{O(n^2 \log n)}.

QUESTION: True or False: In order to get an expected O(n log n) runtime for “paranoid" quicksort (from Lecture 3), we require the recursive divide step to split the array into two subarrays each of at least $\frac{1}{4}$ the size of the original array.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**. In order to achieve an expected O(n log n) runtime for paranoid quicksort, each recursive partition must ensure that both resulting subarrays are at least 1/4 the size of the original array. This balanced splitting prevents worst-case scenarios and ensures efficient recursion, maintaining the desired time complexity.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: A binary min-heap with n elements supports INSERT in O(log n) amortized time and DELETE-MIN in 0 amortized time.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. Both the INSERT operation in a binary min-heap runs in O(log n) amortized time, as does the DELETE-MIN operation. 

- **INSERT**: This involves adding an element to the next available position and then bubbling it up until it's correctly placed, which takes O(log n) time due to the height of the tree.
  
- **DELETE-MIN**: Removing the root (minimum element) requires replacing it with the last element and sifting down to its correct position. This also takes O(log n) time.

Thus, neither operation runs in constant time; both have a logarithmic amortized complexity.

QUESTION: The hash family H = {$h_1, h_2$} is universal, where $h_1, h_2 : $ {1, 2, 3} $\rightarrow$ {0, 1} are defined by the following table:
//// ANSWER: 
The hash family \( H = \{h_1, h_2\} \) is **not** universal. 

For each pair of distinct keys:

- Pair (1,2): Collides in both functions → Probability = 0
- Pair (1,3): Collides in both functions → Probability = 1
- Pair (2,3): Let's check this as well.

For h₁:
- 2→1, 3→0 → different

For h₂:
- 2→0, 3→1 → different

So for pair (2,3), no collisions in either function → Probability = 0.

Thus, the only problematic pair is (1,3) with a collision probability of 1. Since this exceeds \( \frac{1}{m} = \frac{1}{3} \), H fails to be universal.

**Answer:** No, the hash family H is not universal because for the key pair (1,3), the collision probability is 1, which violates the condition for universality.

QUESTION: True or False: Recall the $O(n^3 lg n)$ matrix-multiplication algorithm to compute shortest paths, where we replaced the matrix-multiplication operator pair (*, +) with (+, min). If we instead replace the operator pair with (+, *), then we compute the product of the weights of all paths between each pair of vertices.
//// ANSWER: 
The claim that replacing the operator pair (*, +) with (+, *) in an O(n³ lg n) matrix-multiplication algorithm for shortest paths results in computing the product of all path weights between each pair of vertices is **False**.

When using (min, +), the algorithm computes the shortest paths by taking the minimum sum over possible intermediate nodes. Replacing these operators with (+, *) changes the computation to use addition as the combine operator and multiplication as the multiply operator. However, this does not result in computing the product of all path weights between each pair of vertices.

Instead, using (+, *) computes a different measure where each step involves adding products along possible paths, which is more akin to accumulating sums over multiplicative paths rather than multiplying all such paths' weights together. Therefore, it does not compute the desired product but another aggregate function based on the semiring properties defined by these operators.

**Answer:** False

QUESTION: True or False: Negating all the edge weights in a weighted undirected graph G and then finding the minimum spanning tree gives us the maximum-weight spanning tree of the original graph G.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. Here's why:

1. **Negation of Edge Weights**: When you negate all edge weights in a weighted undirected graph, positive weights become negative and vice versa.

2. **Finding MST in Negated Graph**: The minimum spanning tree (MST) of this negated graph will have the smallest sum of these negated weights.

3. **Correspondence to MaxST**: Since each weight is flipped in sign, the smallest sum in the negated graph corresponds to the largest sum in the original graph's edge weights.

4. **Resulting Spanning Tree**: Therefore, the MST found in the negated graph represents the maximum-weight spanning tree (MaxST) of the original graph because it selects edges that maximize the total weight when considering their positive values.

**Conclusion**: Negating all edge weights and finding the MST yields the MaxST of the original graph.

QUESTION: In a graph with unique edge weights, the spanning tree of second-lowest weight is unique.
//// ANSWER: 
The problem involves determining whether a connected graph with all edges having distinct weights has a unique second-smallest spanning tree (SST). 

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The smallest spanning tree (MST) is unique in such graphs because Krusky's algorithm picks edges in order of increasing weight, ensuring no alternative MST exists.
   - The next question is whether there can be multiple spanning trees with a total weight just above the MST.

2. **Approach**:
   - After identifying the MST using Krusky's or Prim's algorithm, to find the second-smallest spanning tree, we consider replacing one edge of the MST with another non-MST edge that connects the same vertices but has a higher weight.
   - Since all edges have distinct weights, each possible replacement will result in a unique total weight.

3. **Examples and Analysis**:
   - Several examples were analyzed where multiple edges could potentially replace an MST edge. However, due to the uniqueness of edge weights, only one such replacement would yield the minimal next weight without forming cycles.
   - In all examined cases, this process resulted in exactly one possible second-smallest spanning tree.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that each replacement leads to a unique total weight and no alternative replacements can produce a lower or same weight due to distinct edge weights, it's concluded that the second-smallest spanning tree is indeed unique.

$\boxed{\text{Oui}}$

QUESTION: In the recursion of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
//// ANSWER: 
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can indeed be implemented using recursion, though it's more commonly expressed iteratively for clarity and efficiency. Here's a detailed explanation of how this can be done:

1. **Base Case**: When the graph has no vertices (n=0), return an empty distance matrix.

2. **Recursive Step**:
   - Call the algorithm recursively with n-1 to solve for the subgraph excluding one vertex.
   - Use the resulting distance matrix from the recursive call as a base solution.
   - Update this base solution by considering all pairs of vertices (i, j) and checking if going through the newly added vertex provides a shorter path. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     d[i][j] = \min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j])
     \]
     where \( k \) is the new intermediate vertex being considered.

3. **Update Process**: For each pair (i, j), compare the direct path with the sum of paths through the current intermediate vertex and update accordingly.

4. **Termination**: The recursion terminates when all vertices have been processed as intermediates, resulting in the final shortest distance matrix for all pairs of vertices.

This recursive approach effectively builds upon smaller subproblems by incrementally considering each vertex as an intermediate, ensuring that all possible shorter paths are accounted for.

QUESTION: True or False: Consider a network of processes based on an arbitrary undirected graph G = (V, E) with a distinguished vertex $v_0 \in V$. The process at each vertex $v \in V$ starts with a positive integer $x_v$. The goal is for the process at $v_0$ to compute the maximum $max_{v \in V} x_v$. There is an asynchronous distributed algorithm that solves this problem using $O(diam^2d)$ time and $O(|E| + diam \cdot n)$ messages.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement in question claims that there exists an asynchronous distributed algorithm solving a maximum value computation problem on an undirected graph with specific time and message complexities. 

**Analysis:**
- The goal is for node \( v_0 \) to compute the global maximum of values across all nodes, using an asynchronous approach.
- The proposed algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(\text{diam}^2 n) \) and a message complexity of \( O(|E| + \text{diam} \cdot n) \).

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Time Complexity:** 
   - Algorithms for maximum computation in distributed systems typically have a time complexity proportional to the diameter (\( \text{diam} \)) or linear with respect to it, not \( O(\text{diam}^2 n) \). This suggests that the stated time complexity might be excessive.
   
2. **Message Complexity:**
   - The message count being \( O(|E| + \text{diam} \cdot n) \) is plausible as each edge could be involved a constant number of times, and nodes may propagate information proportional to their degree.

**Conclusion:**
The time complexity component (\( O(\text{diam}^2 n) \)) appears inconsistent with standard distributed algorithms for maximum computation. Therefore, the statement's claim about the algorithm's efficiency is likely false.

**Answer:** False

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose a file server stores a hash of every file in addition to the file contents. When you download a file from the server, you also download the hash and confirm that it matches the file. This system securely verifies that the downloaded file has not been modified by an adversary, provided the hash function has collision resistance.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. Here's why:

1. **Hash Function Basics**: A hash function transforms data into a fixed-size string, ensuring deterministic output for identical inputs and quick computation.

2. **Collision Resistance**: A collision-resistant hash function makes it computationally hard to find two different inputs that produce the same output, preventing an adversary from creating a malicious file with the same hash as the original.

3. **Verification Process**: By downloading both the file and its hash, users can verify integrity by comparing hashes. Any alteration to the file changes its hash, ensuring detection unless collision resistance is compromised.

4. **Security Implications**: Using a collision-resistant hash function ensures that tampering with the file would likely change its hash, thus securing the verification process against unauthorized modifications.

In conclusion, this system securely verifies file integrity when using a collision-resistant hash function.

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose Alice, Bob, and Charlie secretly generate a, b and c, respectively, and publish $g^a \mod p, g^b \mod p$, and $g^c \mod p$, where p is a prime. Then, Alice, Bob, and Charles can each compute $g^{abc} \mod p$ as a shared secret known only to the three of them.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. 

In the scenario described, while Alice, Bob, and Charlie can each compute a shared secret using their private exponents and the public keys, they cannot directly compute \( g^{abc} \mod p \) without additional steps or information beyond what's provided. Specifically:

1. **Two-Party Case**: Alice and Bob can compute \( g^{ab} \mod p \) because each knows their own exponent and the other's public key.
2. **Three-Party Extension**: Extending this to three parties (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) requires a method where all three exponents are combined into one shared secret. However, with only \( g^a \), \( g^b \), and \( g^c \), each party cannot directly compute the product of all three exponents (\( abc \)) without further information or steps.

Thus, the claim that each can compute \( g^{abc} \mod p \) as a shared secret known only to them is not achievable under the given conditions.

QUESTION: True or False: The number of memory transfers used by the best cache-oblivious algorithm is always at least the number of memory transfers used by the best external-memory algorithm for the same problem.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The number of memory transfers used by the best cache-oblivious algorithm does not necessarily always exceed that of the best external-memory algorithm for the same problem.

Cache-oblivious algorithms are designed to optimize performance across different cache sizes and architectures without explicit knowledge of these parameters, focusing on internal CPU hierarchy efficiency. On the other hand, external-memory algorithms are tailored to minimize I/O operations when data exceeds main memory capacity, optimizing for disk access patterns.

While both models aim for optimal performance in their respective domains, they focus on different aspects of memory management. External-memory algorithms can be more efficient in terms of reducing I/O operations, which directly impacts the number of memory transfers. Therefore, there exist scenarios where an external-memory algorithm may require fewer memory transfers than a cache-oblivious one, making the statement false.

**Answer:** False

QUESTION: True or False: If there is a time-optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm for a problem, then that algorithm is also optimal with respect to memory transfers in the cache-oblivious model.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

While a time-optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm may exhibit efficient memory access patterns suitable for cache-oblivious models, optimality in one model doesn't automatically ensure optimality in another. Cache-oblivious algorithms specifically optimize for both computational complexity and I/O operations to handle memory hierarchies effectively. Although some divide-and-conquer algorithms are designed with these considerations (e.g., FFT or matrix multiplication), it's not a given that all time-optimal algorithms will also be optimal in the cache-oblivious framework. Thus, optimality in one model doesn't guarantee optimality in another without specific design for memory hierarchy management.

QUESTION: What extra information needs to be stored at each node? Describe how to answer an AVERAGE(x) query in $O(lg n)$ time using this extra information.
//// ANSWER: 
To efficiently answer an average(x) query over a range [a, b] in O(log n) time using a segment tree, each node must store two pieces of information:

1. **sum**: The sum of all elements in the segment represented by the node.
2. **count**: The number of elements in the segment.

### Explanation:
- Each leaf node corresponds to a single element and stores its value as both `sum` and `count = 1`.
- Internal nodes combine their children's information: 
  - `sum` is the sum of the left and right child sums.
  - `count` is the count of the left and right child counts.

To compute the average over [a, b]:
1. Query the segment tree to get the total `sum` for the range [a, b].
2. Compute the length of the range as (b - a + 1).
3. The average is then `total_sum / (b - a + 1)`.

This approach ensures that each query is answered in O(log n) time due to the segment tree's structure allowing efficient range queries.

QUESTION: Describe how to modify INSERT to maintain this information. Briefly justify that the worst-case running time for INSERT remains O(lgn).
//// ANSWER: 
To maintain an O(log n) worst-case running time for insertions, we can modify the insertion process using self-balancing binary search trees such as AVL Trees or Red-Black Trees. Here's how each approach works:

### AVL Tree Approach:
1. **Insertion**: Perform a standard BST insertion to add the new node.
2. **Balancing Check**: After insertion, update the balance factor of the newly inserted node and its ancestors.
3. **Rebalancing**: If any ancestor's balance factor exceeds ±1, perform rotations (left or right) to rebalance the tree.

### Red-Black Tree Approach:
1. **Insertion**: Insert the new node as in a standard BST and color it appropriately.
2. **Balancing Check**: After insertion, check for configurations that violate Red-Black Tree properties (e.g., two consecutive red nodes).
3. **Recoloring or Rotations**: Perform recoloring or rotations to maintain balance without altering the tree's structure drastically.

Both methods ensure that each insertion triggers balancing steps which keep the tree's height logarithmic, thus maintaining O(log n) worst-case time complexity for insertions. This modification is crucial as standard BSTs can degrade to O(n) in worst-case scenarios with skewed trees.

QUESTION: Suppose we send Forrest k reminders for each of n events. What is the expected number of appointments Forrest will remember? Give your answer in terms of k and n.
//// ANSWER: 
The expected number of appointments Forrest will remember can be determined by considering each event and the probability associated with each reminder.

For one event, with k reminders sent, if each reminder has a probability \( p \) of being remembered, the expected number of remembered appointments for that event is \( k \times p \). Extending this to n events, assuming independence between events, the total expected number of remembered appointments is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = n \times (k \times p)
\]

However, since the problem does not provide a specific value for \( p \), we can make an assumption. If each reminder has an equal and independent probability of being remembered such that exactly one out of every k reminders is remembered on average (\( p = \frac{1}{k} \)), then:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = n
\]

Thus, the expected number of appointments Forrest will remember is \( n \).

**Answer:** The expected number of remembered appointments is \( n \).

QUESTION: Suppose we send Forrest k reminders for a single event. How should we set k with respect to n so that Forrest will remember the event with high probability, i.e., 1 – 1/nº?
//// ANSWER: 
To determine how many times Forrest should be reminded (k) about an event relative to the number of days until the event (n) to achieve a high memory probability, we can analyze the problem using probability theory and logarithmic scaling.

**Answer:**

Forrest should set the number of reminders \( k \) proportional to the natural logarithm of \( n \), specifically:

\[
k = c \ln(n)
\]

where \( c \) is a constant greater than 1. This ensures that the probability of Forrest remembering the event approaches \( 1 - \frac{1}{n^\alpha} \) for some exponent \( \alpha \).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Memory Decay:** Human memory tends to decay exponentially over time, meaning each day without a reminder reduces the probability of remembering the event.

2. **Modeling Probability:** If Forrest receives a reminder every day, the probability of remembering on any given day can be modeled using independent trials with success probability \( p \).

3. **Geometric Distribution:** The probability that Forrest remembers the event within \( k \) days is approximately \( 1 - (1-p)^k \). For high probability close to 1, we set this equal to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n^\alpha} \), leading to:

   \[
   (1-p)^k = \frac{1}{n^\alpha}
   \]

4. **Logarithmic Transformation:** Taking natural logarithms and approximating for small \( p \):

   \[
   kp \approx \alpha \ln(n)
   \]

5. **Optimal Reminders:** To ensure high probability, set \( k = c \ln(n) \), where \( c > 1 \). This scaling ensures that the number of reminders grows logarithmically with \( n \), maintaining a high memory probability.

**Conclusion:**

By setting \( k \) proportional to \( \ln(n) \), Forrest can achieve a high probability of remembering the event, specifically approaching \( 1 - \frac{1}{n^\alpha} \).

QUESTION: Suppose we send Forrest k reminders for each of n events. How should we set k with respect to n so that Forrest will remember all the events with high probability, i.e., 1 – 1/nº?
//// ANSWER: 
To ensure Forrest remembers all events with high probability (specifically \(1 - 1/n^\alpha\) where \(\alpha > 0\)), we analyze the number of reminders (\(k\)) per event in relation to the total number of events (\(n\)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Probability of Forgetting an Event**:  
   The probability that Forrest forgets an event after receiving \(k\) reminders can be modeled as \((1 - p)^k\), where \(p\) is the probability of remembering a single reminder. Assuming each reminder has an independent chance of working, we approximate this probability.

2. **Expected Number of Forgotten Events**:  
   For \(n\) events, the expected number of forgotten events is \(n \times (1 - p)^k\). To ensure this expectation is very small and approaches zero as \(n\) grows, we set:
   \[
   n \times (1 - p)^k \leq 1/n^\alpha
   \]

3. **Solving for \(k\)**:  
   Rearranging the inequality gives:
   \[
   (1 - p)^k \leq 1/n^{\alpha + 1}
   \]
   Taking natural logarithms on both sides:
   \[
   k \ln(1 - p) \leq -(\alpha + 1)\ln n
   \]
   For small \(p\), we approximate \(\ln(1 - p) \approx -p\). Thus:
   \[
   -kp \leq -(\alpha + 1)\ln n
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   k \geq (\alpha + 1)\frac{\ln n}{p}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   To achieve the desired high probability of remembering all events, \(k\) should scale with \(n\). Specifically, setting \(k = c \cdot n \log n\) for some constant \(c > \alpha + 1\) ensures that the probability of forgetting any event is sufficiently low.

### Final Answer:
Forrest should set \(k\) proportional to \(n \log n\), i.e., \(k = c \cdot n \log n\) where \(c\) is a constant greater than \(\alpha + 1\). This scaling ensures that the probability of forgetting all events remains high (\(1 - 1/n^\alpha\)) as required.
