QUESTION: True or False: Using similar techniques used in Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's running time can be improved to O(Vlog2 7).
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

Floyd-Warshall's algorithm has a time complexity of O(V³), which arises from its dynamic programming approach involving three nested loops over the vertices. While Strassen's matrix multiplication reduces the exponent in matrix operations through divide-and-conquer, Floyd-Warshall's problem structure—based on graph paths and dynamic programming—does not lend itself to similar optimizations. The algorithm's sequential nature and dependency on intermediate steps make it unlikely that applying such techniques would improve its running time to O(V log² 7). Thus, the claim is incorrect as no known method applies Strassen-like optimizations here.

QUESTION: True or False: For graphs G = (V, E) where E = O(V1.5), Johnson's algorithm is asymptotically faster than Floyd-Warshall.
//// ANSWER: 
True or False: For graphs G = (V, E) where E = O(V¹·⁵), Johnson's algorithm is asymptotically faster than Floyd-Warshall.

**Answer:** True

**Explanation:**

- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** This algorithm has a time complexity of O(V³). It uses dynamic programming to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. The complexity does not depend on the number of edges E, making it less efficient for sparse graphs compared to algorithms that consider E.

- **Johnson's Algorithm:** Johnson's algorithm is more efficient for sparse graphs and has a time complexity of O(V² log V) when using a priority queue (e.g., a binary heap). It first transforms the graph to eliminate negative edge weights, then runs Dijkstra's algorithm on each vertex. 

- **Comparison for E = O(V¹·⁵):** When the number of edges E is proportional to V¹·⁵, it indicates a sparser graph than Floyd-Warshall typically handles efficiently. Johnson's algorithm becomes more favorable because its time complexity (O(V² log V)) grows slower than Floyd-Warshall's O(V³) for large values of V.

Thus, asymptotically, Johnson's algorithm outperforms Floyd-Warshall when dealing with graphs where E = O(V¹·⁵).

QUESTION: True or False: Consider the directed graph where each vertex represents a subproblem in a dynamic program, and there is an edge from p to q if and only if subproblem p depends on (recursively calls) subproblem q. Then this graph is a directed rooted tree.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The directed graph representing dependencies in dynamic programming can be more complex than a single rooted tree. It may consist of multiple trees (a forest) or even have cycles if not properly structured, depending on the problem's nature.

Answer: False

QUESTION: True or False: In a connected, weighted graph, every lowest weight edge is always in some minimum spanning tree.
//// ANSWER: 
True. In any connected, weighted graph, every edge with the minimal weight will be part of at least one minimum spanning tree (MST). This is because Kruskal's algorithm processes edges in order of increasing weight and includes an edge if it connects two previously disconnected components without forming a cycle. Since the minimal-weight edge cannot form a cycle when added first, it must be included in some MST.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: For a connected, weighted graph with n vertices and exactly n edges, it is possible to find a minimum spanning tree in O(n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
True. For a connected, weighted graph with n vertices and exactly n edges (a unicyclic graph), the minimum spanning tree can indeed be found in O(n) time by identifying the unique cycle, determining which edge has the maximum weight within that cycle, and excluding it from the MST.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Graph Structure**: The graph is connected with n vertices and exactly n edges, meaning it contains exactly one cycle (a unicyclic graph).

2. **Cycle Identification**: Use BFS or DFS to traverse the graph. When a back edge is encountered (an edge connecting two already visited nodes that are not parent/child), this identifies the unique cycle.

3. **Determine Maximum Weight Edge in Cycle**: Once the cycle is identified, examine all edges involved and select the one with the highest weight.

4. **Construct MST**: Include all edges except for the maximum weight edge found in step 3. This ensures no cycles are formed while including the minimal possible total edge weight.

This approach leverages the unique structure of unicyclic graphs to efficiently compute the MST in linear time, O(n).

QUESTION: True or False: For a flow network with an integer capacity on every edge, the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm runs in time O((V + E) |f|) where |f| is the maximum flow.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **false**. 

Here's why: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with BFS (Edmonds-Karp) has a worst-case time complexity of O(VE), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This can be worse than O((V+E)|f|), especially when |f| is small compared to V or E. Therefore, the given bound isn't accurate for all cases.

Answer: False

QUESTION: True or False: Let C = (S, V \ S) be a minimum cut in a flow network. If we strictly increase the capacity of every edge across C, then the maximum flow of the network must increase.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding the Min-Cut Max-Flow Theorem**: In any flow network, the maximum flow from the source to the sink equals the capacity of the minimum cut separating these two sets.

2. **Effect of Increasing Capacities in a Minimum Cut**:
   - If C = (S, V \ S) is a minimum cut with total capacity 'c', increasing each edge's capacity across C by some amount will result in a new total capacity for C greater than 'c'.
   
3. **New Minimum Cut Capacity**:
   - Since all edges in C have their capacities increased, the new min cut (which must be at least as large as any other possible cut) is now larger than before.

4. **Impact on Maximum Flow**:
   - The maximum flow is determined by the minimum cut's capacity. Increasing the min cut's capacity ensures that the max flow can also increase to match this higher value, making it impossible for the max flow to remain unchanged or decrease.

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, strictly increasing every edge across a minimum cut C will result in an increased maximum flow through the network.

QUESTION: True or False: Every linear program has a unique optimal solution.
//// ANSWER: 
The answer to the question "True or False: Every linear program has a unique optimal solution" is:

**False**

Every linear program does not necessarily have a unique optimal solution. In some cases, there can be multiple optimal solutions located along an edge or face of the feasible region defined by the constraints. This occurs when the objective function is parallel to one of these edges or faces, resulting in infinitely many points that yield the same optimal value. Therefore, uniqueness of the optimal solution cannot be guaranteed for every linear program.

QUESTION: True or False: 3SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time, even if P = NP.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. 

If P equals NP, then all NP-complete problems like 3SAT would have polynomial-time solutions.

QUESTION: Repeatedly selecting a vertex of maximum degree, and deleting the incident edges, is a 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to find a minimum vertex cover for an undirected graph. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in this set. The challenge is to determine the smallest possible set of vertices that satisfies this condition.

### Approach
The approach leverages the properties of bipartite graphs, where Konig's theorem can be applied efficiently. Here’s the step-by-step plan:

1. **Check Bipartiteness**: Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to check if the graph is bipartite. This involves attempting to color the graph using two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
2. **Find Minimum Vertex Cover**: If the graph is bipartite, Konig's theorem states that the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching in a bipartite graph. However, for this problem, we can simplify it by using BFS to partition the graph into two sets and selecting one set as the vertex cover.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bipartite(graph):
    color = {}
    for node in graph:
        if node not in color:
            queue = deque()
            queue.append(node)
            color[node] = 0
            while queue:
                current = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[current]:
                    if neighbor in color:
                        if color[neighbor] == color[current]:
                            return False
                    else:
                        color[neighbor] = 1 - color[current]
                        queue.append(neighbor)
    return True

def solve():
    # Read input and build the graph
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
    for _ in range(m):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # Check if the graph is bipartite
    if not is_bipartite(graph):
        print("The graph is not bipartite; minimum vertex cover cannot be determined using Konig's theorem.")
        return

    # Perform BFS to partition into two sets
    color = {}
    for node in range(n):
        if node not in color:
            queue = deque()
            queue.append(node)
            color[node] = 0
            while queue:
                current = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[current]:
                    if neighbor in color:
                        continue
                    else:
                        color[neighbor] = 1 - color[current]
                        queue.append(neighbor)

    # The minimum vertex cover is the smaller of the two partitions
    set0 = [node for node in range(n) if color[node] == 0]
    set1 = [node for node in range(n) if color[node] == 1]

    print(f"Minimum vertex cover size: {min(len(set0), len(set1))}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

### Explanation
1. **Bipartiteness Check**: The `is_bipartite` function uses BFS to attempt a two-coloring of the graph. If any edge connects vertices of the same color, the graph is not bipartite.
2. **Partitioning Vertices**: Using BFS again, we partition the graph into two sets based on their colors. Each set represents one side of the bipartition.
3. **Determine Minimum Vertex Cover**: The minimum vertex cover size is the smaller of the two partitions since either partition alone forms a valid vertex cover in a bipartite graph.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum vertex cover for bipartite graphs, leveraging their structural properties to ensure an optimal solution.

QUESTION: Draw the shortest path from Boston to New York in the following graph if m = ∞. Charging stations are marked as circles.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the shortest path from Boston to New York with \( m = \infty \), we must consider that any edge involving a charging station (marked as circles) has an infinite weight, effectively blocking its traversal. 

1. **Identify Blocked Edges**: All edges connected to charging stations are blocked due to their infinite weight.
2. **Evaluate Possible Routes**: Consider alternative routes from Boston to New York that do not involve these blocked edges.
3. **Determine Shortest Path**: Among the remaining viable routes, select the one with the least total cost.

**Answer**: The shortest path from Boston to New York in this graph is direct, avoiding all charging stations and their associated infinite-weight edges.

QUESTION: Draw the shortest path from Boston to New York in the following (identical) graph if m = 100.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the shortest path from Boston (0,0) to New York (5,4) in a grid where each edge has a weight of 1, we can use either Dijkstra's algorithm or recognize that any path requiring exactly 9 steps (5 right and 4 up moves) will be equally short. 

Since all edges have the same weight, the shortest path is simply moving from Boston to New York by making 5 right moves and 4 up moves in any order.

**Answer:**
Any path consisting of 5 right moves and 4 up moves (in any order) constitutes a shortest path from Boston to New York.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to solve the problem. For full credit, your algorithm should run in O(VE + V2 log V) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm you're referring to is likely an optimized version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm designed to handle graphs with negative weights more efficiently while avoiding negative cycles. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a distance matrix `d` where `d[i][j]` represents the shortest known distance from vertex `i` to vertex `j`. Initialize this matrix using the adjacency matrix of the graph, setting `d[i][j]` to the weight of edge `(i,j)` if it exists, or infinity otherwise.

2. **Iterate Over Intermediate Vertices**:
   - For each vertex `k` from 1 to `V`, consider it as an intermediate vertex.
     - Use a deque (double-ended queue) to manage vertices whose distances might need updating when considering `k` as the intermediate.
     - Process edges in both directions: for each edge `(i,j)` where `d[i][j] > d[i][k] + d[k][j]`, update `d[i][j]` and adjust the deque by adding `i` to one end if its distance decreased, or `j` to the other end.

3. **Update Distances**:
   - For each edge `(i,j)`, check if using vertex `k` as an intermediate provides a shorter path: 
     \[
     d[i][j] = \min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j])
     \]
   - If the distance is updated, add `i` to one end of the deque (if its distance decreased) or `j` to the other end.

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - After processing all intermediate vertices, the matrix `d` contains the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

This optimized approach reduces the time complexity from O(V³) in the standard Floyd-Warshall algorithm to O(VE + V² log V), making it more efficient for graphs with a large number of edges.

QUESTION: Give a greedy algorithm that outputs an ordering of the psets that minimizes the total penalty for all the psets. Analyze the running time and prove correctness.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine an optimal sequence for processing tasks such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each task is calculated as its weight multiplied by the difference between its deadline and its position in the processing order. 

### Approach
The key insight is to prioritize tasks based on a specific ratio that helps minimize penalties. The optimal strategy involves sorting the tasks in descending order of their weight-to-deadline ratio (w_i / d_i). This approach ensures that tasks with higher weights relative to their deadlines are processed earlier, thereby reducing potential penalties.

### Solution Code
```python
def schedule_tasks(tasks):
    # Sort tasks based on the ratio w/d in descending order
    sorted_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda x: (x[0]/x[1]), reverse=True)
    return [task[2] for task in sorted_tasks]

# Example usage:
tasks = [(5, 1), (3, 4), (8, 2), (6, 5)]  # Each tuple is (weight, deadline, task_id)
sorted_order = schedule_tasks(tasks)
print("Processing order:", sorted_order)
```

### Explanation
1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to minimize the total penalty incurred by processing tasks in a specific order. Each task has a weight and a deadline, and penalties are calculated as the product of these factors if the task's position exceeds its deadline.

2. **Intuition**: Tasks with higher weights relative to their deadlines contribute more significantly when processed earlier. By prioritizing such tasks, we can minimize the overall penalty.

3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using a sorting algorithm based on the ratio (weight / deadline) in descending order ensures that tasks contributing more to reducing penalties are scheduled first.

4. **Complexity Analysis**: The sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of tasks, which is efficient for this problem.

This approach efficiently determines the optimal processing order, ensuring minimal total penalty by leveraging the weight-to-deadline ratio as the primary sorting key.

QUESTION: First look at the special case where the maze is just a single path of length |E| from s to t, and all the edges have capacity 1 (see below). Exactly how many nights are required for the teens to escape?
//// ANSWER: 
The number of nights required for the teens to escape is exactly equal to the length of the path, which is |E|. Therefore, they need precisely |E| nights.

**Answer:** Exactly |E| nights are required.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of nights to escape, by making calls to the magic algorithm. Analyze your time complexity in terms of V, E, m, a, and T(V, E, m).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the minimum number of nights required to escape using the magic algorithm, we can model the problem as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's a structured approach:

### Algorithm Outline:
1. **Graph Representation**: Use adjacency lists or matrices to represent the graph where each node is a state/location and edges represent possible moves.
2. **Initialization**:
   - Start BFS from the initial position (node).
   - Maintain a queue for BFS traversal.
   - Mark nodes as visited once encountered.
3. **BFS Loop**:
   - Dequeue a node, check if it's the exit; if yes, return the current depth (number of nights).
   - Enqueue all unvisited adjacent nodes with incremented depth.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where no path exists by ensuring appropriate termination.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- **Standard BFS**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, as each node and edge are processed once.
- **With Steps per Night (m)**: If each night allows up to m steps/edges, the time complexity becomes O((V + E)/m). This assumes processing m edges per night.

### Variables:
- **V**: Number of nodes in the graph.
- **E**: Number of edges connecting these nodes.
- **m**: Maximum number of moves (steps) allowed per night.
  
This approach efficiently finds the shortest path, ensuring minimal nights required to escape.

QUESTION: Now give the “magic” algorithm, and analyze its time complexity.
//// ANSWER: 
To address the question about the "magic" algorithm and its time complexity, let's consider several common algorithms often highlighted for their efficiency:

1. **Binary Search**: This algorithm operates in O(log n) time, making it highly efficient for searching in sorted arrays.

2. **Merge Sort**: With a time complexity of O(n log n), Merge Sort is a stable sort known for its consistent performance across various data sets.

3. **QuickSort**: While typically operating at an average case of O(n log n), QuickSort's worst-case scenario is O(n²). However, it is often one of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice.

4. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Utilizing FFT allows for efficient computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it ideal for signal processing and polynomial multiplication tasks.

5. **Shor's Algorithm**: This quantum algorithm provides an exponential speedup over classical methods, with a time complexity of O((log N)^3), making it particularly significant in the field of cryptography.

Each of these algorithms offers unique advantages depending on the problem at hand. If the "magic" algorithm refers to one of these, its time complexity can be analyzed accordingly. However, without specific context, this analysis remains speculative. For a precise answer, identifying which algorithm is being referred to would be necessary.

QUESTION: Give an algorithm to find a driver assignment di ∈ Si for each day i such that no person j has to drive more than their limit lj. (The algorithm should output “no” if there is no such assignment.)
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we can model it as a bipartite graph with maximum flow constraints. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Model the Problem**:
   - Create nodes for each day (source side) and each driver (sink side).
   - Connect days to drivers based on availability.

2. **Set Up Capacities**:
   - Each day node is connected from the source with capacity 1.
   - Each driver node connects to the sink with capacity equal to their maximum allowed assignments.

3. **Construct Edges**:
   - For each driver available on a day, create an edge between the driver and that day with unlimited capacity (or sufficient value).

4. **Compute Maximum Flow**:
   - Use a max flow algorithm to determine if all days can be assigned without exceeding driver capacities.
   - If the maximum flow equals the number of days, a feasible assignment exists.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - If a solution is found, output the assignments; otherwise, indicate no solution exists.

This approach ensures we efficiently check for feasibility and find an optimal assignment if possible.

QUESTION: Give a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a directed graph G contains either a cycle or a Hamiltonian path (or both).
//// ANSWER: 
To determine whether a directed graph \( G \) contains either a cycle or a Hamiltonian path, we can break down the approach into two main parts:

1. **Cycle Detection**: 
   - We first check for any self-loops (cycles of length 1). This can be done in \( O(n) \) time by examining each vertex to see if it has an edge pointing to itself.
   - If no self-loops are found, we perform a topological sort using Kahn's algorithm. This involves calculating the in-degree for each vertex and repeatedly selecting vertices with zero in-degree until all vertices are processed or a cycle is detected (if some vertices remain unprocessed). Kahn's algorithm runs in \( O(n + m) \) time, where \( n \) is the number of vertices and \( m \) is the number of edges.

2. **Hamiltonian Path Check**:
   - If no cycles are found using the above steps, we then need to check for a Hamiltonian path. However, finding a Hamiltonian path in a directed graph is an NP-hard problem, meaning there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for it unless \( P = NP \).
   - For practical purposes, this step would require either:
     - Using heuristic or approximation methods (which may not always find a solution even if one exists).
     - Employing algorithms that work efficiently for specific types of graphs but are not guaranteed to handle all cases.

**Conclusion**: 
While we can efficiently detect cycles in polynomial time using topological sort, determining the existence of a Hamiltonian path remains computationally intensive and cannot be solved in polynomial time unless \( P = NP \). Therefore, without an efficient algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian path, the problem as stated does not have a known solution that works for all directed graphs in polynomial time.

QUESTION: Show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a directed graph G' contains both a cycle and a Hamiltonian Path, by giving a reduction from the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem: given a graph G, decide whether it has a Hamiltonian path. (Recall from recitation that the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem is NP-complete.)
//// ANSWER: 
To reduce the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem to the HAMILTONIAN CYCLE problem, follow these steps:

1. **Start with Graph G**: Consider a graph \( G \) with \( n \) vertices.

2. **Add Two New Vertices**: Introduce two new vertices \( s \) and \( t \).

3. **Connect New Vertices to G**:
   - Connect vertex \( s \) to every vertex in \( G \).
   - Connect every vertex in \( G \) to vertex \( t \).

4. **Resulting Graph (G')**: The new graph \( G' \) includes all vertices of \( G \), plus the two new vertices \( s \) and \( t \). All edges from \( s \) to each vertex in \( G \) and from each vertex in \( G \) to \( t \) are added.

5. **Reduction**:
   - If graph \( G \) contains a Hamiltonian Path, then graph \( G' \) will contain a Hamiltonian Cycle formed by traversing this path starting at \( s \), proceeding through the vertices of the path, and ending at \( t \), followed by returning to \( s \).
   - Conversely, if graph \( G' \) contains a Hamiltonian Cycle, it must traverse each vertex exactly once. This cycle will pass through all vertices in \( G \) between \( s \) and \( t \), thereby forming a Hamiltonian Path in the original graph \( G \).

This construction ensures that the existence of a Hamiltonian Path in \( G \) is equivalent to the existence of a Hamiltonian Cycle in \( G' \). Thus, this reduction demonstrates that HAMILTONIAN PATH can be transformed into HAMILTONIAN CYCLE while preserving the problem's solution.

QUESTION: True or False: With all equal-sized intervals, a greedy algorithm based on earliest start time will always select the maximum number of compatible intervals.
//// ANSWER: 
The greedy algorithm that selects intervals based on their start times (earliest start) will indeed yield the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals when all intervals are of equal length. This is because with equal-length intervals, both the earliest start and earliest finish approaches effectively partition the timeline without overlapping, ensuring an optimal selection.

**Answer:**  
Yes, using the greedy algorithm based on selecting intervals by their start time will result in the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals when all intervals are of equal length.  

$\boxed{\text{Yes}}$

QUESTION: True or False: The problem of weighted interval scheduling can be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true. The problem of weighted interval scheduling can indeed be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming.

**Answer:**

True. The weighted interval scheduling problem can be solved in O(n log n) time using a dynamic programming approach. Here's how:

1. **Sort Intervals:** First, sort all the intervals by their end times.
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:** For each interval i, determine the last non-overlapping interval j that ends before i starts.
3. **Binary Search:** Use binary search to efficiently find this interval j in O(log n) time for each i.
4. **DP Transition:** The maximum weight up to interval i is either including it (weight_i + DP[j]) or excluding it (DP[i-1]).
5. **Complexity:** This results in an overall time complexity of O(n log n), as each step involves sorting and binary search.

Thus, the weighted interval scheduling problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(n log n).

QUESTION: True or False: If we divide an array into groups of 3, find the median of each group, recursively find the median of those medians, partition, and recurse, then we can obtain a linear-time median-finding algorithm.
//// ANSWER: 
The method described does not result in a linear-time median-finding algorithm.

**Answer:** False.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Grouping Strategy**: The approach divides the array into groups of 3 and finds their medians recursively. However, this strategy doesn't sufficiently reduce the problem size each time to achieve linear complexity.

2. **Recursion Impact**: While finding medians of these groups might provide a pivot for partitioning, it's not guaranteed that the recursion will eliminate enough elements to keep the time complexity in check.

3. **Comparison with Median of Medians**: Typically, algorithms like the median of medians use group sizes (like 5) to ensure efficient partitioning and reduce the problem size effectively. Using groups of 3 may lead to higher complexity due to insufficient elimination of elements.

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, this method doesn't guarantee a linear-time solution for finding the median.

QUESTION: True or False: If we used the obvious Θ(n²) merge algorithm in the divide-and-conquer convex-hull algorithm, the overall time complexity would be O(n² log n).
//// ANSWER: 
The use of an Θ(n²) merge algorithm in the divide-and-conquer convex-hull approach results in a higher overall time complexity. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Divide and Conquer Approach**: The standard divide-and-conquer method for computing the convex hull has a time complexity of O(n log n). It works by recursively splitting the point set into halves, solving each half, and then merging the results.

2. **Merging Step Normally**: Typically, the merge step is efficient, taking O(n) time because it combines two convex polygons with linear operations.

3. **Naive Merge Algorithm**: Using an obvious Θ(n²) approach for merging means comparing every point from both subsets, leading to a quadratic time complexity at each merge step.

4. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation becomes T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + O(n²). Here, the dominant term is O(n²), which grows faster than n log n.

5. **Solving the Recurrence**: Using the Master Theorem or summing the geometric series for each level of recursion shows that the total time complexity becomes Θ(n²).

**Conclusion**: The overall time complexity would be O(n²) when using an Θ(n²) merge algorithm, not O(n² log n). 

Answer: False

QUESTION: Van Emde Boas sort (where we insert all numbers, find the min, and then repeatedly call SUCCESSOR) can be used to sort n = lg u numbers in O(lg u·
//// ANSWER: 
Van Emde Boas sort is an efficient algorithm that leverages the Van Emde Boas tree data structure to perform operations such as insertion and successor efficiently. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Data Structure**: The Van Emde Boas tree is used, which allows for O(log u) time complexity per insertion and successor operation, where u is the universe size.

2. **Insertion Process**: Inserting each of the n = lg u numbers into the tree takes O(n log u) time because each insertion involves splitting and merging clusters within the tree structure.

3. **Sorting via Successor Calls**: After all elements are inserted, they can be retrieved in sorted order by starting from the minimum element (which is found in O(1) or O(log u) time) and repeatedly calling the successor operation until all elements are traversed. Each call to successor takes O(log u) time.

4. **Traversal Time**: With m = lg u elements, the number of successor calls required is m - 1, leading to a traversal time of O(m log u).

5. **Total Complexity**: Combining insertion and traversal times gives an overall complexity of O(n log u + n log u) = O((lg u)^2). Therefore, sorting using Van Emde Boas sort has a time complexity of O((log u)^2), making it efficient for this specific scenario.

**Answer**: Yes, Van Emde Boas sort can be used to sort n = lg u numbers in O((log u)^2) time.

QUESTION: True or False: Van Emde Boas on n integers between 0 and u 1 supports successor queries in O(lg lg u) worst-case time using O(n) space.

QUESTION: True or False: In the potential method for amortized analysis, the potential energy should never go negative.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement "In the potential method for amortized analysis, the potential energy should never go negative" is **False**.

**Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Potential Method:** The potential method in amortized analysis uses a potential function to map data structure states to real numbers, representing stored energy or resources. This allows us to analyze the average cost per operation over a sequence of operations.

2. **Role of Potential Function:** The potential function can take any real value (positive or negative) as it is chosen based on convenience and correctness for the specific problem being analyzed. It does not inherently require non-negativity unless it simplifies analysis in that particular case.

3. **Amortized Cost Calculation:** The amortized cost of an operation is computed as the actual cost plus the change in potential. This calculation remains valid even if the potential function becomes negative, ensuring accurate amortized cost assessments.

4. **Flexibility in Potential Function Choice:** There's no strict rule against allowing the potential to be negative. Its flexibility allows for modeling scenarios where resources might deplete, which can still lead to correct amortized cost analyses.

In conclusion, while non-negative potentials are often chosen for simplicity and ease of analysis, there is no requirement that the potential energy must remain non-negative in all cases.

QUESTION: True or False: The quicksort algorithm that uses linear-time median finding to run in worst-case O(n log n) time requires O(n) auxiliary space.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Time Complexity**: The modified quicksort algorithm uses linear-time median finding to select a pivot, reducing the worst-case time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n). This part of the statement is correct.

2. **Auxiliary Space**: 
   - The standard recursive implementation of quicksort has a recursion depth that can be up to O(n), especially in cases like sorted arrays, leading to O(n) auxiliary space for the call stack.
   - While some implementations use iterative methods or tail recursion optimization (TRO) to reduce this, TRO isn't universally supported and not all implementations do it. Without such optimizations, the algorithm still requires O(n) auxiliary space.

3. **Median-Finding Impact**: The linear-time median-finding method (e.g., BFPT) doesn't add extra storage beyond what's needed for quicksort, so it doesn't increase auxiliary space requirements.

4. **Conclusion**: Although the time complexity is improved to O(n log n), the auxiliary space remains O(n) due to recursion depth in the worst case. Thus, the statement claiming O(n) auxiliary space is accurate, making the overall answer False because the question's assertion about auxiliary space is correct but the statement itself is false regarding a different aspect (time vs. space). Wait, no—the original statement says it requires O(n) auxiliary space while having O(n log n) time. Since that part is correct, the statement as a whole would be True if only considering time, but since it's about both time and space, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify: The question asks whether this specific quicksort variant requires O(n) auxiliary space while having worst-case O(n log n) time. From the analysis:

- Yes, it does require O(n) auxiliary space due to recursion depth.
- It has O(n log n) time because of the median pivot selection.

Therefore, the statement is True: The algorithm uses linear-time median finding to achieve O(n log n) worst-case time and requires O(n) auxiliary space. So my initial conclusion was wrong; it's actually True.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions now. Let me re-express:

The question is about whether this version of quicksort (with median pivot and linear-time median finding) has O(n) auxiliary space while running in worst-case O(n log n). From the analysis, yes: the time complexity is correct, and the space is O(n). So the statement is True.

But earlier I thought it was False. Now I'm confused because after re-examining, both parts are correct—so the answer should be True.

Wait no, in my initial response, I concluded that the statement is False, but upon further analysis, it's actually True. Let me clarify:

The question states: "True or False: The quicksort algorithm... requires O(n) auxiliary space."

From the analysis:
- Yes, this version of quicksort does require O(n) auxiliary space due to recursion depth.
- It also achieves worst-case O(n log n) time.

Therefore, the statement is **True** because both claims are correct. However, in my initial response, I mistakenly concluded False, but upon re-examining, it's True.

Wait no—no, wait: The question asks if it requires O(n) auxiliary space. Since that part is accurate (O(n)), and the time complexity is also as stated, then the entire statement is True.

But in my initial detailed thought process, I concluded False because of a misunderstanding about the recursion depth. Let me correct that:

Upon re-evaluating:
- The algorithm's time complexity is correctly O(n log n).
- The auxiliary space required is indeed O(n) due to recursion stack.
- Therefore, the statement "requires O(n) auxiliary space" is True.

Thus, the overall answer should be **True**. However, in my initial detailed response, I mistakenly concluded False, which was incorrect.

Final Answer: **True**

The quicksort algorithm that uses linear-time median finding for pivot selection indeed requires O(n) auxiliary space and achieves a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

QUESTION: True or False: Searching in a skip list takes O(log n) time with high probability, but could take Ω(2n) time with nonzero probability.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is false because while skip list searches typically run in O(log n) time with high probability and Ω(n) on average or worst case (if all levels are populated), it does not specifically imply that the worst-case time could be Ω(2n). Instead, the correct worst-case complexity is linear, which can be represented as Ω(n), but 2n isn't a standard way to express this. Therefore:

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Average and High-Probability Case**: Skip list searches are O(log n) time.
2. **Worst-Case Scenario**: The worst-case time is linear, i.e., Ω(n).
3. **Statement Analysis**: The statement incorrectly uses 2n to denote a specific linear case instead of the general linear complexity.

Answer: False

QUESTION: The following collection H = {h1,h2, h3} of hash functions is uni-versal, where each hash function maps the universe U = {A, B, C, D} of keys into the range {0, 1, 2} according to the following table:
//// ANSWER: 
The collection \( H = \{h_1, h_2, h_3\} \) is a universal family of hash functions for the domain \( U = \{A, B, C, D\} \) and codomain \( V = \{0, 1, 2\} \). 

For each pair of distinct elements in \( U \), there exists exactly one function in \( H \) that maps them to the same value. Specifically:
- \( (A,B) \) collide under \( h_1 \),
- \( (A,C) \) collide under \( h_2 \),
- \( (A,D) \) collide under \( h_3 \).

For all other pairs (\( B,C \), \( B,D \), \( C,D \)), no function in \( H \) maps them to the same value. Therefore, for every distinct pair \( x,y \in U \), the probability of collision is at most \( 1/3 \), which satisfies the condition for a universal family.

**Answer:** Yes, \( H \) is a universal family because each pair has a collision probability of at most \( 1/3 \).

**Answer:** Ben forgot to include a 1/N scaling factor in his FFT or iFFT calculations.

QUESTION: Give the fastest data structure you can for this problem, measured according to worst-case time.
//// ANSWER: 
To determine the fastest data structure for your problem in terms of worst-case time complexity, please provide the specific task or problem you are addressing. This will allow me to offer a precise and relevant solution.

QUESTION: Design a data structure to maintain a set S of n distinct integers that supports the following two operations:
//// ANSWER: 
To design a data structure that efficiently maintains a set \( S \) of \( n \) distinct integers and supports insertion as well as finding the \( k \)-th smallest element, we can consider several approaches. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Approach 1: Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)
A balanced BST ensures efficient operations for both insertion and order statistics.

- **Insertion**: Each insertion operation takes \( O(\log n) \) time due to the tree's balance.
- **Finding the \( k \)-th Smallest Element**: This can be done by maintaining subtree sizes at each node, allowing traversal in \( O(\log n) \) time.

### Approach 2: Two Heaps
Using a max-heap for the first \( k \) elements and a min-heap for the remaining elements allows efficient retrieval of the \( k \)-th smallest element.

- **Insertion**: Each insertion involves adding to one heap or rebalancing between heaps, each operation taking \( O(\log n) \) time.
- **Finding the \( k \)-th Smallest Element**: Directly accessible from the max-heap's top after balancing.

### Approach 3: Skip List
A skip list provides efficient average-case performance for both operations with probabilistic balancing.

- **Insertion and Finding \( k \)-th Element**: Both operations are performed in \( O(\log n) \) expected time due to the skip list's structure.

### Conclusion
The best data structures for this problem, considering efficiency and ease of implementation, are:

1. **Balanced BST (e.g., AVL or Red-Black Tree)**: Offers guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for both operations with a more complex implementation.
2. **Two Heaps**: Provides an alternative approach that is easier to implement but may require rebalancing.
3. **Skip List**: An efficient probabilistic data structure suitable for the required operations.

Each choice has its trade-offs between implementation complexity and performance guarantees, making them suitable depending on specific use cases.

QUESTION: Describe an O(n)-time randomized algorithm for testing whether p(x) · q(x) = r(x) that satisfies the following properties:
//// ANSWER: 
The problem can be solved using a randomized algorithm that evaluates the polynomials at a single randomly chosen point and checks if the product equals the third polynomial. This approach runs in linear time.

**Answer:**

To determine whether \( R(x) = P(x) \cdot Q(x) \), we can use a probabilistic method with an expected runtime of \( O(n) \). Here's how:

1. **Choose a Random Point:** Select a random integer \( x \) from a sufficiently large range (e.g., between 1 and \( N \), where \( N \) is much larger than the coefficients of the polynomials).

2. **Evaluate Polynomials at \( x \):** Use Horner's method to evaluate each polynomial \( P(x) \), \( Q(x) \), and \( R(x) \). This step takes \( O(n) \) time for each evaluation.

3. **Check Equality:** Compute the product \( P(x) \cdot Q(x) \) and compare it with \( R(x) \). If they are equal, output "yes"; otherwise, output "no".

This method works because if \( R = P \cdot Q \), then their evaluations at any point must match. The probability of choosing a point where the polynomials coincide by chance is low for large \( N \).

The overall time complexity is \( O(n) \) since each polynomial evaluation is linear in \( n \).

QUESTION: Prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 1.
//// ANSWER: 
To prove that our algorithm satisfies Property 1, we need to first understand what Property 1 entails. Assuming it refers to correctness, here's a structured approach:

### Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof of Correctness

**1. Define Property 1:**
Assuming Property 1 is about the algorithm producing correct outputs for all valid inputs.

**2. Outline the Algorithm:**
Clearly describe the algorithm in question, including its steps and any data structures used.

**3. Termination Proof:**
Demonstrate that the algorithm halts after a finite number of steps. This ensures it doesn't run indefinitely.

- **Example:** For bubble sort, each pass reduces the unsorted portion until all elements are sorted, ensuring termination.

**4. Validity Proof:**
Show that if the algorithm terminates, it returns correct results.

- **For Bubble Sort:** Each iteration correctly positions the next largest element at its correct position, leading to a fully sorted array.

**5. Use of Loop Invariants or Induction:**
Formalize correctness using mathematical induction or loop invariants.

- **Example:** For bubble sort, each pass maintains that elements are correctly positioned up to a certain index, ensuring correctness after all passes.

**6. Consider Efficiency (if Property 1 Pertains to Time Complexity):**
Analyze the algorithm's running time and compare it against expected bounds using Big O notation.

- **Example:** Bubble sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), which can be compared against more efficient algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.

**7. Robustness and Edge Cases:**
Test the algorithm with extreme values, invalid inputs, etc., to ensure it handles all cases correctly.

- **Example:** Ensure that bubble sort works correctly with negative numbers, duplicates, and single-element arrays.

**8. Conclusion:**
Summarize how the algorithm meets Property 1 by addressing termination and validity, possibly including efficiency considerations if applicable.

### Example Proof for Bubble Sort Correctness

**Property 1 (Correctness):** Bubble sort produces a fully sorted array from an unsorted input.

**Proof:**

- **Termination:** Bubble sort repeatedly passes through the array, comparing adjacent elements. Each pass reduces the number of unsorted elements by at least one until all elements are in place. Thus, it terminates after O(n) passes, where n is the number of elements.

- **Validity:** After each complete pass, the largest unsorted element bubbles up to its correct position at the end of the array. This process ensures that each subsequent pass works on a smaller subarray, maintaining correctness until all elements are sorted.

Hence, bubble sort satisfies Property 1 by correctly sorting any given array and terminating after a finite number of steps.

**Note:** If Property 1 pertains to another aspect (e.g., time complexity or space efficiency), similar structured reasoning can be applied with appropriate modifications.

QUESTION: Prove that your algorithm satisfies Property 2.
//// ANSWER: 
To prove that an algorithm satisfies Property 2, we need to follow a structured approach based on the likely nature of Property 2. Here's a general framework tailored for different possible properties:

### General Framework for Proving Algorithm Satisfaction of Property 2

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly define the problem the algorithm is designed to solve.
   
2. **Algorithm Description**: Provide a detailed explanation of how the algorithm works, including key components or data structures.

3. **Property Clarification**: Define what Property 2 entails (e.g., correctness, efficiency, robustness).

4. **Proof Structure**:
   - **Correctness**: Use examples and logical reasoning to show the algorithm produces correct results.
   - **Efficiency**: Analyze computational complexity and compare with other algorithms if applicable.
   - **Scalability/Resource Usage**: Show resource constraints are manageable for large inputs.
   - **Mathematical Property**: Apply relevant theorems or lemmas for convergence or optimization.
   - **Termination**: Prove the algorithm stops after finite steps.

5. **Conclusion**: Summarize why the algorithm satisfies Property 2 based on the proof.

### Example Proof for Correctness (Property 2)

**Problem**: Algorithm X solves problem Y, which requires finding a solution in graph traversal.

**Algorithm Description**: Algorithm X uses BFS to find the shortest path from node A to node B.

**Proof of Correctness**:
- **Base Case**: For small graphs, manually verify that BFS finds the correct shortest path.
- **Inductive Step**: Assume BFS works for all graphs with up to n nodes. Show it works for a graph with n+1 nodes by demonstrating each step maintains correctness.
- **Generalization**: Since every possible graph configuration is handled correctly through these steps, Algorithm X always finds the shortest path.

**Conclusion**: Algorithm X satisfies Property 2 (correctness) as proven through base case verification and inductive reasoning.

This framework can be adapted based on the specific details of Property 2 to provide a comprehensive proof.

QUESTION: Design a randomized algorithm to check whether p(x) · q(x) = r(x) that is correct with probability at least 1 ε. Analyze your algorithm in terms of n and 1/ε.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine if the product of two polynomials \( p \) and \( q \) equals a third polynomial \( r \). Each polynomial is represented as a list of coefficients where the index corresponds to the power of \( x \).

### Approach
1. **Polynomial Multiplication**: The product of two polynomials can be computed by convolving their coefficient lists. This involves multiplying each term of the first polynomial with each term of the second polynomial and summing up the results appropriately.
2. **Handling Zero Polynomials**: If either \( p \) or \( q \) is an empty list, it means one of the polynomials is zero, so their product will be a zero polynomial (an empty list).
3. **Comparison**: After computing the product of \( p \) and \( q \), we compare this result with \( r \). If they are identical, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

### Solution Code
```python
def multiply_polynomials(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return []
    m = len(a)
    n = len(b)
    result = [0] * (m + n - 1)
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            result[i + j] += a[i] * b[j]
    return result

# Read input
p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
q = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
r = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

product = multiply_polynomials(p, q)

# Compare product with r
if product == r:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The coefficients of the polynomials \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \) are read from standard input.
2. **Multiplying Polynomials**: The `multiply_polynomials` function computes the product by iterating over each term of both polynomials, multiplying them, and accumulating the results in a new list.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If either polynomial is empty (i.e., has no terms), the result is an empty list, indicating a zero polynomial.
4. **Comparison**: The resulting product from `multiply_polynomials` is compared directly with \( r \). If they match exactly, it means \( p \times q = r \), and we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".

This approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including the presence of zero polynomials and exact coefficient matching.

QUESTION: Define TLij to be maximum tastiness value in the top-left quadrant of cell (i, j): TLi,j = max{Ta,b | 1 ≤ a ≤ i, 1 ≤ b ≤ j}. Find a dynamic programming algorithm to compute TLi,j, for all 1 < i < n and 1 < j < m, in O(nm) time.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum value encountered in each subgrid starting from the top-left corner (0,0) to each cell (i,j). This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

### Approach
The approach involves creating a 2D array `dp` where each element `dp[i][j]` holds the maximum value found in the subgrid from (0,0) to (i,j). The key insight is that each cell's maximum value can be derived from either the cell directly above it or the cell directly to its left. 

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a 2D array `dp` with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Base Case**: Set `dp[0][0]` to the value of the input grid at (0,0) since this is our starting point.
3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each cell in the first row (i=0), the maximum value can only come from the left neighbor because there are no cells above it.
   - For each cell in the first column (j=0), the maximum value can only come from the top neighbor because there are no cells to its left.
   - For all other cells, the maximum value is the greater of the values from the top neighbor and the left neighbor.

### Solution Code
```python
def max_subgrid_value(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Initialize first cell
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                continue  # already initialized
            elif i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(grid[i][j], dp[i][j-1])
            elif j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(grid[i][j], dp[i-1][j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(grid[i][j], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    
    return dp[rows-1][cols-1]
```

### Explanation
The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum value in each subgrid. By iterating through each cell and considering only the necessary neighbors (top or left), we ensure that each cell's value is computed in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n*m) where n and m are the dimensions of the grid. This approach ensures that we efficiently build up the solution incrementally, reusing previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.

QUESTION: Use the idea in part (a) to obtain an O(nm) algorithm to find the tastiest dish.
//// ANSWER: 
To solve this problem for \( m \) courses efficiently, we can use dynamic programming combined with an efficient method similar to part (a). Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Start by considering the first course as the initial state.

2. **Iterative Combination**:
   - For each subsequent course from 2 to \( m \):
     - Use the solution from part (a) to combine the current accumulated results with the new course's dishes.
     - This step efficiently computes the maximum possible sum for each dish in the current course based on previous selections.

3. **Update State**: After processing each course, update the state to include the newly computed maximum sums.

4. **Result Extraction**: The final result is the maximum value from the accumulated state after all courses have been processed.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the solution for \( m \) courses using an iterative method based on part (a)'s efficient combination technique, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(mn) \), where \( n \) is the number of dishes per course.

QUESTION: Give a naïve algorithm running in O(m + n) time.
//// ANSWER: 
The naive algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time involves checking whether all characters of one string (A) are present in another string (B) with at least the same frequency. Here's how it works:

1. **Create a Frequency Map for B**: Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each character in string B.

2. **Iterate Through A**:
   - For each character in A, check if it exists in the frequency map.
   - Ensure that the count of this character in A does not exceed its count in B.

3. **Return Result**: If all characters meet the criteria, return true; otherwise, false.

This approach ensures O(m + n) time complexity by processing each string once and performing constant-time operations per character.

**Edge Cases**:
- If A is empty, return true.
- If both are empty, return true.
- Handle non-alphabet characters efficiently using a dictionary.

The algorithm uses minimal space (constant for the frequency map), fitting within O(m + n) constraints.

QUESTION: If m = n, give an algorithm that runs in O(lgn) time.
//// ANSWER: 
Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time when m equals n.

2. **Identify Possible Algorithms**:
   - Binary search is a common O(log n) algorithm, but it requires sorted data.
   - Exponentiation by squaring can compute large powers efficiently in O(log b) time.

3. **Assess Context**: Assuming the problem allows for sorted data access (like binary search), proceed with that approach.

4. **Apply Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to find a target value or perform an operation on a sorted array.
   - The algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half, leading to logarithmic time complexity.

5. **Conclusion**: Using binary search is suitable when m = n and data is sorted, providing an O(log n) solution.

**Answer**: Use binary search for an O(log n) algorithm when dealing with a sorted array of size n (where m = n).

QUESTION: Give an algorithm that runs in O(lg(min{m, n})) time, for any m and n.
//// ANSWER: 
The algorithm you're referring to efficiently finds an element common to both of two sorted arrays by leveraging a two-pointer technique combined with exponential search reduction. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Start with pointers at the beginning (i=0) and end (j=n-1) of the larger array.
2. **Comparison Loop**:
   - If elements at i and j are equal, return this element as a common element.
   - Adjust pointers based on comparison: increment i if A[i] is smaller, or decrement j if B[j] is smaller.
3. **Termination**: The loop continues until an intersection is found or the pointers go out of bounds.

This method ensures each step reduces the problem size by half, resulting in O(log min(m, n)) time complexity.

**Answer:**
The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach to find a common element between two sorted arrays efficiently. By comparing elements and adjusting pointers based on comparisons, it narrows down the search space logarithmically, achieving an O(log min{m, n}) time complexity. This method works by halving the problem size each step until a common element is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

**Final Answer:**
The algorithm runs in O(log min(m, n)) time and efficiently finds a common element between two sorted arrays using a two-pointer technique with exponential search reduction.

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose algorithm A has two steps, and A succeeds if both the steps succeed. If the two steps succeed with probability $p_1$ and $p_2$ respectively, then A succeeds with probability $p_1p_2$.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is true under the assumption that the two steps are independent. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Algorithm A has two sequential steps. For A to succeed, both steps must succeed.

2. **Independent Events:** If the success of each step does not affect the other (independent events), then the combined probability is the product of individual probabilities.

3. **Calculation:** Probability of success for both steps = p1 * p2.

**Answer:**
True. Algorithm A succeeds with probability \( p_1 \times p_2 \) if the two steps are independent.

QUESTION: True or False: If the divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm (from Lecture 2) used a $\Theta(n^2)$ strategy to discover the maximum and minimum tangents, the overall algorithm would run in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
//// ANSWER: 
The divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm's overall time complexity depends on how tangents are found during the merge phase.

If a Θ(n²) strategy is used to find maximum and minimum tangents, each recursive step would take O(n²) time. Since there are log n levels of recursion (as the problem size halves at each level), the total time complexity becomes:

O(n² × log n)

Thus, the statement is True.

Answer: True

QUESTION: True or False: In order to get an expected O(n log n) runtime for “paranoid" quicksort (from Lecture 3), we require the recursive divide step to split the array into two subarrays each of at least $\frac{1}{4}$ the size of the original array.
//// ANSWER: 
The recursive divide step does not necessarily need to ensure both resulting subarrays are at least 1/4 of the original array size to achieve O(n log n) performance. While such a condition can prevent excessive recursion depth and maintain efficiency, it's not strictly required. Other methods like pivot selection strategies or switching to algorithms for small arrays suffice.

**Answer:** False

QUESTION: True or False: A binary min-heap with n elements supports INSERT in O(log n) amortized time and DELETE-MIN in 0 amortized time.
//// ANSWER: 
False: A binary min-heap with n elements supports INSERT in O(log n) amortized time but DELETE-MIN has a time complexity of O(log n), not 0.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Binary Min-Heap Operations:**
   - **Insert (INSERT):** Adds an element to the heap, placing it at the next available position in the last level. The element is then sifted up until it's smaller than its parent or reaches the root.
     - **Time Complexity:** O(log n) because each insertion may require moving up log n levels on average.

2. **Amortized Analysis for INSERT:**
   - Amortized analysis spreads the cost of operations over a sequence, showing an average cost per operation.
   - Over n insertions, total sift-up moves are proportional to n log n, averaging O(log n) per insertion.

3. **Delete-MIN Operation:**
   - Removes the root element (minimum value), replacing it with the last element in the heap.
     - This new element is then sifted down until it's larger than its children or reaches a leaf.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(log n) because sifting down can take up to log n steps.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The statement that DELETE-MIN has 0 amortized time is incorrect; it actually takes O(log n) time, same as INSERT.

**Answer:**

False. A binary min-heap supports INSERT in O(log n) amortized time but DELETE-MIN also requires O(log n) time, not constant (O(1)) time.

QUESTION: The hash family H = {$h_1, h_2$} is universal, where $h_1, h_2 : $ {1, 2, 3} $\rightarrow$ {0, 1} are defined by the following table:
//// ANSWER: 
To determine if the hash family \( H = \{h_1, h_2\} \) is universal, we need to verify that for any two distinct elements \( x \) and \( y \) in the domain \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), the probability that \( h(x) = h(y) \) over all hash functions \( h \in H \) is at most \( \frac{1}{|Y|} \), where \( |Y| = 2 \). This means the collision probability should be ≤ \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Analysis of Example Hash Functions:
Assume the following definitions for the hash functions based on an example:

- **\( h_1 \):**
  - \( h_1(1) = 0 \)
  - \( h_1(2) = 1 \)
  - \( h_1(3) = 0 \)

- **\( h_2 \):**
  - \( h_2(1) = 0 \)

### Conclusion:

QUESTION: True or False: Recall the $O(n^3 lg n)$ matrix-multiplication algorithm to compute shortest paths, where we replaced the matrix-multiplication operator pair (*, +) with (+, min). If we instead replace the operator pair with (+, *), then we compute the product of the weights of all paths between each pair of vertices.
//// ANSWER: 
The process described involves using matrix multiplication under a different operator pair (+, *), which effectively computes the minimal product of edge weights along any path between nodes. This approach can be seen as finding the "shortest" path in terms of the product metric.

**Answer:**

Yes, after replacing the operators with (+, *), each entry \( C[i][j] \) in the resulting matrix represents the minimum possible product of edge weights along all paths from node \( i \) to node \( j \). This is analogous to finding a shortest path but using multiplication instead of addition. 

So, if you perform this kind of matrix multiplication multiple times or iteratively, each entry will accumulate information about these minimal products for different paths.

The final answer is:

\boxed{C[i][j] = \min_{k} (A[i][k] * B[k][j])}

QUESTION: True or False: Negating all the edge weights in a weighted undirected graph G and then finding the minimum spanning tree gives us the maximum-weight spanning tree of the original graph G.
//// ANSWER: 
True or False: Negating all the edge weights in a weighted undirected graph G and then finding the minimum spanning tree gives us the maximum-weight spanning tree of the original graph G.

**Answer:** True.

Explanation:
When you negate all edge weights in an undirected graph G, the problem of finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) on these negated weights is equivalent to finding the maximum-weight spanning tree in the original graph. This works because:

1. **Negation Reverses Edge Orderings:** Negating each edge weight reverses their order from highest to lowest and vice versa.
2. **MST on Negated Weights:** The MST algorithm selects edges with the smallest sum of weights. When these weights are negated, this selection corresponds to choosing edges that maximize the original positive weights.
3. **Equivalence in Selection:** Thus, finding an MST on the negated graph yields a spanning tree where the sum of the original edge weights is maximized.

Therefore, the method described correctly produces the maximum-weight spanning tree of G.

QUESTION: In a graph with unique edge weights, the spanning tree of second-lowest weight is unique.
//// ANSWER: 
In a graph where all edge weights are unique, the minimum spanning tree (MST) is unique due to Kruskal's algorithm selecting edges without ties. However, the second-best spanning tree, which has the next lowest total weight after the MST, may not be unique. This is because there can be multiple edges that can be swapped in the MST with other edges from outside the MST, each resulting in a different but similarly weighted spanning tree. Therefore:

**Answer:**  
No, the spanning tree of second-lowest weight is not necessarily unique in such graphs.

QUESTION: In the recursion of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
//// ANSWER: 
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can indeed be implemented using a recursive approach. Here's how it works:

1. **Base Case**: The initial distance matrix \( D^0 \) is constructed, where each entry \( D^0[i][j] \) represents the direct edge weight between vertices \( i \) and \( j \), or infinity if there is no direct edge.

2. **Recursive Step**: For each vertex \( k \) from 1 to \( n \) (where \( n \) is the total number of vertices):
   - Update the distance matrix by considering paths that go through vertex \( k \).
   - For each pair of vertices \( i \) and \( j \), check if the path from \( i \) to \( j \) through \( k \) (i.e., \( D^k[i][j] = \min(D^{k-1}[i][j], D^{k-1}[i][k] + D^{k-1}[k][j]) \)) provides a shorter path.

3. **Termination**: The recursion terminates after considering all vertices as intermediate points, resulting in the final distance matrix containing the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

This recursive approach effectively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, incrementally building up the solution by considering each vertex as an additional intermediate point.

QUESTION: True or False: Consider a network of processes based on an arbitrary undirected graph G = (V, E) with a distinguished vertex $v_0 \in V$. The process at each vertex $v \in V$ starts with a positive integer $x_v$. The goal is for the process at $v_0$ to compute the maximum $max_{v \in V} x_v$. There is an asynchronous distributed algorithm that solves this problem using $O(diam^2d)$ time and $O(|E| + diam \cdot n)$ messages.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

In a distributed system on an undirected graph aiming to compute the maximum value among all nodes, known algorithms for max computation do not have a time complexity of O(diam²n). The standard approaches typically achieve a linear or diameter-based complexity relative to the network's size and diameter. Therefore, the proposed algorithm with such a high time complexity is unlikely to exist.

Answer: False

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose a file server stores a hash of every file in addition to the file contents. When you download a file from the server, you also download the hash and confirm that it matches the file. This system securely verifies that the downloaded file has not been modified by an adversary, provided the hash function has collision resistance.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **True**.

A file server storing both the original files and their hashes allows for secure verification of file integrity when downloaded. The presence of collision resistance in the hash function ensures that it is computationally infeasible for an adversary to find two different files with the same hash, thereby making tampering with the file highly detectable. When a user downloads a file along with its hash and compares the provided hash against the one computed from the downloaded content, any modification to the file would result in a mismatched hash, thus confirming the integrity of the download.

While collision resistance alone does not guarantee absolute security (as theoretical attacks could still exist), it significantly mitigates the risk of undetected tampering. In practice, modern cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 are considered collision-resistant enough for secure applications, making this system a reliable method for verifying file authenticity.

QUESTION: True or False: Suppose Alice, Bob, and Charlie secretly generate a, b and c, respectively, and publish $g^a \mod p, g^b \mod p$, and $g^c \mod p$, where p is a prime. Then, Alice, Bob, and Charles can each compute $g^{abc} \mod p$ as a shared secret known only to the three of them.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

In the given scenario, Alice, Bob, and Charlie each generate random numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) respectively, and publish \( g^a \mod p \), \( g^b \mod p \), and \( g^c \mod p \). The question is whether each can compute \( g^{abc} \mod p \) as a shared secret known only to the three of them.

While the Diffie-Hellman key exchange allows two parties to establish a shared secret using their private exponents, extending this concept to three parties (each with their own exponent) is not straightforward. Specifically, each party would need additional information or a more advanced protocol beyond exchanging their individual \( g^a \), \( g^b \), and \( g^c \) values to compute \( g^{abc} \mod p \). Therefore, it's not feasible for each party to independently compute the shared secret \( g^{abc} \mod p \) without further coordination or a different cryptographic protocol.

QUESTION: True or False: The number of memory transfers used by the best cache-oblivious algorithm is always at least the number of memory transfers used by the best external-memory algorithm for the same problem.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**. The number of memory transfers used by the best cache-oblivious algorithm does not always exceed or equal those of the best external-memory algorithm for the same problem. While both aim to minimize memory transfers, external-memory algorithms can sometimes achieve fewer transfers due to their optimization for handling large datasets and specific data access patterns, which may outperform cache-oblivious approaches in certain scenarios.

QUESTION: True or False: If there is a time-optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm for a problem, then that algorithm is also optimal with respect to memory transfers in the cache-oblivious model.
//// ANSWER: 
The statement is **False**.

While certain divide-and-conquer algorithms that are time-optimal can indeed be designed in a way that optimizes memory transfers (cache misses) under the cache-oblivious model, this is not universally true for all problems. The efficiency of an algorithm in terms of both computation time and memory access patterns depends on the specific problem structure and how well it minimizes cache misses. Therefore, being time-optimal does not necessarily ensure optimality in terms of memory transfers within the cache-oblivious framework for every problem.

QUESTION: What extra information needs to be stored at each node? Describe how to answer an AVERAGE(x) query in $O(lg n)$ time using this extra information.
//// ANSWER: 
To efficiently answer an **average(x)** query in \(O(\lg n)\) time using a segment tree, you must store additional information at each node beyond the basic value or aggregate (like sum). Here's how it works:

### Extra Information Stored at Each Node:
1. **Sum of Elements**: The sum of all elements in the interval represented by the node.
2. **Count of Elements**: The number of elements in the interval.

This extra information allows us to compute both sums and averages efficiently across any range query.

---

### How to Answer an Average Query:

#### Step 1: Query Setup
- To find the average of a subarray from index \( l \) to \( r \):
  - Use the segment tree to break down the interval [\( l, r \)] into a minimal number of segments (nodes) that exactly cover [\( l, r \)]. This is typically done in \( O(\lg n) \) time.

#### Step 2: Aggregating Information
- For each node that covers part of the interval [\( l, r \)], retrieve:
  - The **sum** (\( S_i \)) of elements in that node's interval.
  - The **count** (\( C_i \)) of elements in that node's interval.

#### Step 3: Compute Total Sum and Count
- Sum all the individual sums \( S_i \) to get the total sum \( S_{total} = \sum S_i \).
- Sum all the individual counts \( C_i \) to get the total count \( C_{total} = \sum C_i \).

#### Step 4: Calculate Average
- The average is given by:
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{S_{total}}{C_{total}}
  \]

---

### Time Complexity:
Each query traverses \( O(\lg n) \) nodes, and each node's information (sum and count) can be accessed in constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity for an average query is \( O(\lg n) \).

By storing both sum and count at each node, we enable efficient computation of averages over any subarray using a segment tree.

QUESTION: Describe how to modify INSERT to maintain this information. Briefly justify that the worst-case running time for INSERT remains O(lgn).
//// ANSWER: 
To maintain an O(log n) worst-case running time for insertions in a binary search tree (BST), we need to ensure that the tree remains balanced after each insertion. This can be achieved using techniques like treap, splay trees, or maintaining subtree sizes.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Impact of Insertion on Tree Balance:**
   - Each insertion in a BST involves moving from the root to the appropriate leaf node.
   - In a perfectly balanced tree (e.g., complete binary search tree), insertions take O(log n) time.
   - In an unbalanced tree resembling a linked list, insertions can take O(n) time.

2. **Implement Self-Balancing Techniques:**
   - **Treap:** Combine BST properties with heap properties using random priorities to ensure balance through rotations during insertion and deletion.
   - **Splay Trees:** Automatically balance the tree based on access patterns by performing splay operations, which move frequently accessed nodes closer to the root.
   - **Subtree Size Maintenance:** Track the size of each subtree to facilitate efficient splits and joins without explicit balancing steps.

3. **Maintain Balance Post-Insertion:**
   - After inserting a node, use rotations (in treaps) or other balancing operations to ensure the tree height remains logarithmic relative to the number of nodes.
   - This ensures that future insertions continue to operate efficiently within O(log n) time complexity.

By employing these techniques, we can modify the insertion algorithm to maintain an optimal worst-case running time of O(log n).
