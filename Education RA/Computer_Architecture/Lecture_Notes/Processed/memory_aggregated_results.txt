   - A clock symbol labeled "C" is present, indicating timing control.
   - The diagram uses a grid layout for clarity, with components aligned horizontally and vertically.

This schematic represents a basic ALU setup with RAM, showing how data is processed and stored.

The image consists of two horizontal switch diagrams, one labeled "Off" and the other "On."

1. **Top Diagram (Off):**
   - On the left, there is a dark green circle inside a black square.
   - A dark green line extends horizontally to the right from the circle.
   - There is a small red circle at the start of the line and a small blue circle at the end of the line.
   - On the right, the line connects to a dark green circle inside a black outlined circle.
   - The word "Off" is written to the right of the circle.

2. **Bottom Diagram (On):**
   - On the left, there is a light green circle inside a black square.
   - A light green line extends horizontally to the right from the circle.
   - There is a small red circle at the start of the line and a small blue circle at the end of the line.
   - On the right, the line connects to a light green circle inside a black outlined circle.
   - The word "On" is written to the right of the circle.

The diagrams visually represent the states of a switch, with color changes indicating the transition between "Off" and "On."

The image shows two diagrams representing RAM modules. Each diagram is a rectangular block with labeled components inside and outside the block. 

### Left Diagram:
- The rectangle is labeled "RAM" at the bottom.
- Inside the rectangle, there are vertical labels:
  - "A" at the top.
  - "Din" below "A".
  - "str" below "Din".
  - "C" below "str".
  - "ld" at the bottom.
- To the right of the rectangle, there is a label "D" with a red dot next to it.
- On the left side of the rectangle, there are blue dots aligned with each label inside, and an arrow pointing to the left.

### Right Diagram:
- The rectangle is labeled "RAM" at the bottom.
- Inside the rectangle, there are vertical labels:
  - "A" at the top.
  - "str" below "A".
  - "C" below "str".
  - "ld" at the bottom.
- To the right of the rectangle, there is a label "D" with a red dot next to it.
- On the left side of the rectangle, there are blue dots aligned with each label inside, and an arrow pointing to the left.

Both diagrams are similar, with the left diagram having an additional "Din" label compared to the right diagram.

The image depicts a schematic symbol for an operational amplifier (op-amp). It consists of a triangular shape pointing to the right. 

- The triangle is outlined in black.
- There are three nodes connected to the triangle:
  - One blue circle is at the top of the triangle, representing the non-inverting input.
  - Another blue circle is on the left side of the triangle, representing the inverting input.
  - A red circle is on the right side of the triangle, representing the output.

This symbol is commonly used in electronic circuit diagrams to represent an op-amp.

=== D_latch.png ===
The image is a diagram of a D latch circuit. It includes the following components and connections:

1. **Title and Labeling:**
   - The top of the diagram is labeled "D Latch."
   - There is a label "D Latch_test" with a green button labeled "Test" on the left side.

2. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - The input is labeled "D" and is represented by a square with a circle inside it on the left side.
   - There are two outputs on the right side, labeled "Q" and "Q̅" (Q bar).

3. **Logic Gates:**
   - The circuit includes an inverter (NOT gate), represented by a triangle with a circle at the tip.
   - Two NAND gates are present, each represented by a curved line with two inputs and a circle at the output.

4. **Connections:**
   - The input "D" connects directly to the lower NAND gate and also to the inverter.
   - The output of the inverter connects to the upper NAND gate.
   - The outputs of the NAND gates are cross-coupled, meaning the output of one gate is connected to an input of the other gate.
   - The output of the upper NAND gate is labeled "R" and connects to the output "Q."
   - The output of the lower NAND gate is labeled "S" and connects to the output "Q̅."

5. **Wiring:**
   - The wiring is shown in blue, with lines connecting the gates and inputs/outputs.
   - There are small red dots indicating junctions where wires meet.

This diagram represents the logic design of a D latch, showing how the input "D" is processed through the gates to produce the outputs "Q" and "Q̅."
