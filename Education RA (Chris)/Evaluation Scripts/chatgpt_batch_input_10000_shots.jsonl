He was going to base his language on Caffeine from Moon Microsystems, but negotiations broke down. He has therefore decided to extend FLK! and has hired you, a top FLK! consultant, to assist with modifying the language to support these new features. The new language is called FLK#, part of Sam Antics' new .GOV platform. The big feature of FLK# is user tracking and quotas in the store. An important customer observed that government users tended to use the store carelessly, resulting in expensive memory upgrades. To improve the situation, the FLK# store will maintain a per-user quota. (A quota restricts the number of cells a particular user can allocate.) The Standard Semantics of FLK! are changed as follows:\n\n\\(w\\in\\text{UserID}=\\text{Int}\\)\n\\(q\\in\\text{Quota}=\\text{UserID}\\rightarrow\\text{Int}\\)\n\\(\\gamma\\in\\text{Cmdcont}=\\text{UserID}\\rightarrow\\text{Quota}\\rightarrow\\text{Store} \\rightarrow\\text{Expressible}\\)\n\nerror-cont : Error \\(\\rightarrow\\) Cmdcont\n\n\\(=\\lambda y\\). \\(\\lambda w\\). \\(\\lambda q\\). \\(\\lambda s\\). (Error\\(\\mapsto\\)Expressible \\(y\\)) UserID is just an integer. User ID \\(0\\) is reserved for the case when no one is logged in. Quota is a function that when given a UserID returns the number of cells remaining in the user's quota. The quota starts at 100 cells, and a user's quota is tracked throughout the lifetime of the program (i.e., the quota is not reset upon logout). Cmdcont has been changed to take the currently logged in user ID, the current quota, and the current store to yield an answer. Plus, FLK# adds the following commands:\n\n\\(E\\quad::=\\)\\(\\ldots\\)[Classic FLK! expressions] \\(\\begin{array}[]{l}\\text{(login! }w)\\ \\text{(logout!)}\\ \\text{(check-quota)}\\end{array}\\)[Log in user \\(w\\)] [Log out current user] [Check user quota] (login! \\(w\\)) - logs in the user associated with the identifier \\(w\\); returns \\(w\\) (returns an error if a user is already logged in or if the UserID is 0) (logout!) - logs the current user out; returns the last user's identifier (returns an error if there is no user logged in) (check-quota) - returns the amount of quota remaining The definition of \\(\\mathcal{E}[\\text{(check-quota)}]\\) is:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{E}[\\text{(check-quota)}]=\\)\n\n\\(\\lambda_{ekwq}\\). **if**\\(w=0\\)\n\n\\(\\text{\\bf then }error\\text{-}cont\\)\\(\\text{no-user-logged-in }\\;\\;w\\;\\;\\;q\\)\n\n\\(\\text{\\bf else }(\\text{k }(\\text{Int}\\mapsto\\text{Value }\\;(q\\;\\,w))\\;w\\;\\;q)\\)**fi**\n\n: Naturally, Sam Antics wants to embed some \"trap doors\" into the .GOV platform to enable him to \"learn more about his customers.\" One of these trap doors is the undocumented (raise-quota! n) command, which adds n cells to the quota of the current user and returns 0. Give the definition of \\(\\mathcal{E}[\\{\\texttt{raise-quota! }E\\}]\\)."

Ben Bitdiddle has been learning about functional programming, and while he still prefers PostFix, he is intrigued by the notion of currying. He proposes two new PostFix constructs that permit creating and taking apart PostFix procedures. The constructs are called pack and unpack.\n\n- **pack** expects the first value on the stack to be a number \\(n\\), and it expects there to be at least \\(n\\) more values on the stack. It packages together the next \\(n\\) values on the stack, \\(c_{n},\\ldots,c_{1}\\), as a command sequence \\(C=(c_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ c_{n})\\) and pushes \\(C\\) on the stack.\n\n- **unpack** expects the first value on the stack to be a command sequence \\(C=(c_{1}\\ldots c_{n})\\). It pushes \\(c_{1},\\ldots,c_{n},n\\) on the stack in that order.\n\nIf the preconditions are not met, the operational semantics gets stuck.\n\nunpack permits the PostFix stack to contain commands, which was previously impossible. For example, consider the following PostFix program:\n\n\\[(N_{3}\\ \\ N_{2}\\ \\ N_{1}\\ \\ (\\text{add}\\ \\ \\text{add})\\ \\ \\text{exec})\\Rightarrow N _{1}+N_{2}+N_{3}\\]\n\nWe can think of (add add) as a procedure of three arguments that adds \\(N_{1}\\), \\(N_{2}\\), and \\(N_{3}\\). Using unpack and pack, we can write a currying procedure that takes a three-argument procedure, \\(N_{1}\\), and \\(N_{2}\\), and outputs a procedure that takes one argument \\(N_{3}\\) and outputs \\(N_{1}+N_{2}+N_{3}\\). The currying procedure is (unpack 2 add pack) and it works as follows:\n\n\\[(N_{2}\\ \\ N_{1}\\ \\ (\\text{add}\\ \\ \\text{add})\\ \\ (\\text{unpack}\\ \\ 2\\ \\ \\text{ add }\\ \\text{pack})\\ \\ \\text{exec})\\Rightarrow(N_{2}\\ N_{1}\\ \\text{add add})\\]\n\nBen's company has built proprietary optimization technology that can convert this command sequence to \\((N_{4}\\ \\ \\text{add})\\), where \\(N_{4}=N_{1}+N_{2}\\).

The call-closure construct applies the code component of a closure to the specified arguments, supplying the closure itself as an implicit first argument.\n\nNew employee Bud Lojack, recalling a recent 6.821 problem set on partial evaluation, suggests inlining and reducing the calls to \\(f\\) in the original example to yield:\n\n```scheme\n(primop + [1/b]E [2/b]E)\n```\n\nBud says, \"Before my nifty transformation, the program had to allocate a closure for \\(f\\). But the transformed program doesn't even have a definition for \\(f\\), so no closure for \\(f\\) is ever allocated! So my transformation reduces the space used by the program.\"\n\n: Give an expression \\(E_{let}\\) such that:\n\n- The semantics of the following expression is preserved by Bud's transformation:\n  ```scheme\n  (let ((f (lambda (b) (primop + a b))))\n    E_{let})\n  ```\n- AND the transformed expression allocates more _space for closures_ than the original expression.\n\n(Recall that the language is functional.)"

Ben Bitdiddle, the engineer in charge of the MCPS phase in the Tortoise compiler, looked over the book and the previous years' finals and couldn't find the meta-cps rule for `label` and `jump`. As Ben is very rushed - the new Tortoise compiler should hit the market in the middle of the holiday season - he's asking for your help. Here is a quick reminder of the semantics of `label` and `jump`:\n\n- `(label I E)` evaluates \\(E\\) inside \\(E\\), \\(I\\) is bound to the continuation of `(label I E)`. The labels are statically scoped (as the normal Scheme variables are).\n- `(jump E1 E2)` calls the continuation resulted from evaluating \\(E1\\), passing to it the result of evaluating \\(E2\\). \\(E1\\) should evaluate to a label (i.e., a continuation introduced by `label`). The behavior of `(jump E1 E2)` is unspecified if \\(E1\\) doesn't evaluate to a label (this is considered to be a programming error).\n\nE.g.: The expression `(label foo (+ 1 (jump foo (+ 2 (jump foo 3)))))` should evaluate to 3. Ben even wrote the SCPS rules for `label` and `jump`:\n\n\\\\[SCPS[(\\\\text{label } I E)] = (\\\\text{lambda (k)} \\\\quad (\\\\text{let ((I k))} \\\\quad (\\\\text{call } SCPS[E] \\\\text{ k)}))\\\\]\n\n\\\\[SCPS[(\\\\text{jump } E1 E2)] = (\\\\text{lambda (k1)} \\\\quad (\\\\text{call } SCPS[E1] \\\\quad (\\\\text{lambda (k2)} \\\\quad (\\\\text{call } SCPS[E2] \\\\text{ k2)})))\\\\]\n\nb.

Ben has decided to add the following features to FLK!:\n\n\\[E::=\\ldots\\text{all FLK! forms}\\ldots\\mid(\\text{loop }E)\\mid(\\text{exit }E)\\mid(\\text{jump})\\]\n\nHere's an example of how Ben's new loop construct would work:\n\n```scheme\n(let ((c (cell 0)))\n  (loop\n    (begin\n      (primop cell-set! c (+ (primop cell-ref c) 1))\n      (if (> (cell-ref c) 10)\n          (exit (primop cell-ref c))\n          (jump)))))\n```\n\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) 11\n\nAs one of Ben's grad students, your job is to write the denotational semantics for FLK! with his new looping functionality. Ben has already revised the domain equations for you:\n\n\\[j\\in\\text{Jumpcont}=\\text{Cmdcont}\\]\n\\[x\\in\\quad\\text{Exitcont}=\\text{Expcont}\\]\n\nHe's also changed the signature of the \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) meaning function so that every expression is evaluated with both a jump and an exit continuation:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{E}:\\text{Exp}\\rightarrow\\text{Environment}\\rightarrow\\text{Jumpcont}\\rightarrow\\text{Exitcont}\\rightarrow\\text{Expcont}\\rightarrow\\text{Cmdcont}\\]\n\nBen did give you the meaning function clause for \\(\\mathcal{E}[\\text{(jump)}]\\) for reference.\n\n\\[\\mathcal{E}[\\text{(jump)}]=\\lambda ejzk\\cdot j\\]\n\n: Show that \\((\\text{loop }\\text{(jump)})\\) is equivalent to bottom."

The form (self \\(E\\)) calls the containing procedure with an actual parameter that is the result of evaluating \\(E\\).\n\nThe FLKI expression grammar is changed by the addition of the form (self \\(E\\)):\n\n\\(E\\quad::=\\quad\\ldots\\:\\:\\:\\texttt{existing}\\:\\:\\:\\texttt{FLKI}\\:\\:\\:\\texttt{forms} \\:\\:\\:\\cdot.\\\\)\n\n\\(\\mid\\quad\\quad(\\texttt{self}\\:\\:E)\\\\)\n\nHere is an example of the use of (self \\(E\\)) written in FLI (which would be desugared into FLKI before execution):\n\n```scheme\n(let ((fact (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (self (- n 1))))))) (fact 4))\n```\n\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\)24\n\nBen further specifies that when (self \\(E\\)) is used outside of a procedure it causes the program to terminate immediately with a value that is the result of evaluating \\(E\\).\n\nBen begins describing the denotational semantics of the self form by modifying the signature of the meaning function, \\(\\mathcal{E}\\). His new signature is:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{E}\\quad:\\quad\\texttt{Exp}\\rightarrow\\texttt{Environment}\\to\\texttt{SelfProc }\\rightarrow\\texttt{ExpCont}\\rightarrow\\texttt{CmdCont}\\)\n\n\\(\\texttt{SelfProc}\\quad=\\quad\\texttt{Procedure}\\)\n\nBen asks you to complete the denotational description of the self form because he is going to a conference to give a speech on why FLI is the language of the future.\n\n: Use your semantics to show (\\(\\texttt{proc}\\:\\texttt{x}\\) (\\(\\texttt{self}\\:\\texttt{1}\\))) evaluates to a procedure that, no matter what input it is called with, loops forever."

Ben suggests to JavaHard that they include a region identifier in every procedure type:\n\n\\\\[T\\\\quad::=\\\\quad...|(\\\\rightarrow\\\\ \\\\ (T^{*})\\\\ T\\\\ R)\\\\]\n\nJust as regions are assigned to cells, every procedure will be assigned a new region identifier except when two procedures are aliased together.\n\nA procedure in E can be explicitly freed if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the procedure is in region R, (2) region R is not in the type of any free variables of E, and (3) region R is not in the type of E.\n\nExcited about explicit freedom, Ben invents a new primitive called (%procedure-free x) that frees the procedure represented by value x. In the following example, the lambda expression (lambda (y) y) is bound to x and freed:\n\n```scheme\n(let ((x (lambda (y) y)))\n  (%procedure-free x))\n```\n\nLet E be an expression that contains a non-nested lambda expression P. From effect analysis, we know that P's value is no longer needed after E completes. Thus, Ben would like to use (%procedure-free x) to free the procedure value corresponding to P. Help Ben by writing a translation function for E that will free the value of P and return the value of E. Use [v/P]E to substitute the variable v for lambda expression P in E. Assume that your translation occurs before MCPS conversion and that the variable v does not appear in E.\n\n\\\\[T[E]\\\\!=\\\\!(\\\\texttt{let }((v\\\\ P))\\\\\\\\ \\\\qquad\\\\ldots\\\\texttt{fill in text here}\\\\ldots\\\\ )\\\\]"

Ben suggests to JavaHard that they include a region identifier in every procedure type:\n\n\\\\[T\\\\quad::=\\\\quad...|(\\\\rightarrow\\\\ \\\\ (T^{*})\\\\ T\\\\ R)\\\\]\n\nJust as regions are assigned to cells, every procedure will be assigned a new region identifier except when two procedures are aliased together.\n\nA procedure in E can be explicitly freed if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the procedure is in region R, (2) region R is not in the type of any free variables of E, and (3) region R is not in the type of E.\n\nExcited about explicit freedom, Ben invents a new primitive called (%procedure-free x) that frees the procedure represented by value x. In the following example, the lambda expression (lambda (y) y) is bound to x and freed:\n\n```scheme\n(let ((x (lambda (y) y)))\n  (%procedure-free x))\n```\n\nLet E be an expression that contains a non-nested lambda expression P. From effect analysis, we know that P's value is no longer needed after E completes. Thus, Ben would like to use (%procedure-free x) to free the procedure value corresponding to P. Help Ben by writing a translation function for E that will free the value of P and return the value of E. Use [v/P]E to substitute the variable v for lambda expression P in E. Assume that your translation occurs before MCPS conversion and that the variable v does not appear in E.\n\n\\\\[T[E]\\\\!=\\\\!(\\\\texttt{let }((v\\\\ P))\\\\\\\\ \\\\qquad\\\\ldots\\\\texttt{fill in text here}\\\\ldots\\\\ )\\\\]"
