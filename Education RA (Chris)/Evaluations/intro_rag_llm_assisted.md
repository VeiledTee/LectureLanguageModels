|-------------|-------|----------|
| 156473_sol000 | 1 | The response describes a dynamic programming solution to a problem related to the prompt, but it incorrectly defines the recurrence relation. The recurrence relation provided does not account for the constraint that Tiffany can only play at most twice in any seven day period. |
| 156473_sol001 | 1 | The response has some correct ideas, such as using dynamic programming, but the approach is not clearly articulated and the complexity is not justified. The proposed 3D array does not align well with the subsequences requirements, and the logic for filling the array is vague. The mention of a 3D array of size n x n x n is unusual, when the ground truth expects O(n^4) because of the constraints on the lengths of the subsequences in A and B to be roughly half the length of sequence C. Furthermore, it is not described how the 'concatenation' of subsequences will be determined. Does not describe base cases, topo ordering etc. |
| 156473_sol002 | 1 | The LLM correctly defined the subproblems, but got the indices wrong. It uses the prefix instead of suffix. It defined the base case, but did not fully provide the recurrence or time complexity analysis. |
| 156473_sol003 | 1 | The LLM answer defines x(i) as the cost to catch up to monster i, while the ground truth defines x(i, j) as the minimum cost of catching monsters mᵢ to mₙ, starting at location mⱼ for j ≤ i. The LLM response does not satisfy all components of the ground truth, and thus is only partially correct. |
| 20ec72_sol000 | 1 | The response attempts to use dynamic programming with a modified Bellman-Ford. However, it does not construct a new graph G' as specified in the ground truth, and the Bellman-Ford approach outlined is not correct. The algorithm presented in the response does not guarantee finding the minimum weight cycle with exactly k edges containing vertex v. It also incorrectly claims an improvement over the traditional Bellman-Ford algorithm. It also doesn't handle negative weight cycles correctly. |
| 20ec72_sol001 | 0 | The proposed solution of adding a new vertex s' and running Dijkstra's from there does not account for the color change cost and thus will not find the path with minimum color cost. The approach does not incorporate the color labeling of the edges or the penalty for changing colors. |
| 20ec72_sol002 | 0 | The LLM response proposes using Dijkstra's algorithm with a modification. However, Dijkstra's algorithm is not O(k) in this context. The correct approach, as outlined in the ground truth, involves constructing a specific graph and using BFS, which achieves O(k) time complexity. The LLM's reasoning for O(k) time complexity is also flawed. |
| 20ec72_sol003 | 0 | The response proposes an incorrect algorithm that doesn't correctly identify and count negative cycles in a cycle-sparse graph. Running Bellman-Ford from each vertex and incrementing a counter if a negative path weight is found will overcount cycles and also fail to correctly identify when multiple vertices are reachable from the same cycle. |
| 20ec72_sol004 | 1 | The LLM response suggests using Dijkstra's algorithm, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it proposes modifying the edge weights to be the minimum of the original weight and [b/2], which is incorrect and doesn't address the core issue of negative edge weights and potential exhaustion/overflow of the battery. It also fails to properly address the reweighting of the graph with vertex potentials. |
| d2f991_sol000 | 0 | Both answers are incorrect. The ground truth answer is O(n^2). The response's answers are O(nk) and O(n) |
| d2f991_sol001 | 0 | The response provides an incorrect expected time complexity of O(n+k) instead of O(n). |
| d2f991_sol002 | 0 | The LLM's answers are wrong. It seems to have misidentified the algorithm of the two functions. It should be O(n+k). |
| d2f991_sol003 | 1 | The response correctly states the expected running time for Function 1 as O(n+k). However, the running time stated for Function 2 is incorrect, as it doesn't acknowledge that the prompt requested the expected running time. |
| d2f991_sol004 | 0 | The LLM response is incorrect. Only A can be the item with the smallest integer key in a min-heap. B cannot be the root of the heap. The LLM seems to misunderstand the fundamental property of a min-heap. |
| d2f991_sol005 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly identifies only item C, while the ground truth includes B, C, D, E, F, and G. The LLM also seems to confuse the index and the key. |
| d2f991_sol006 | 0 | The provided answer incorrectly identifies possible locations of the largest integer in a min-heap. It incorrectly claims any node except A could be the largest. The correct answer is that the largest integer must be in one of the leaf nodes: F, G, H, I, J. The response shows a misunderstanding of min-heap properties. |
| d2f991_sol007 | 0 | The answer is completely wrong. It doesn't match the ground truth in either the 'before' or 'after' state. The numbers and order are incorrect. |
| d2f991_sol008 | 0 | The response is completely wrong. It incorrectly identifies the element to be deleted, and it gives the wrong leaf order after the deletion. |
| d2f991_sol009 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly identifies counting sort as the most efficient algorithm given the constraints and provides a good justification for why it's appropriate and the time complexity. |
| d2f991_sol010 | 0 | The response suggests using Counting Sort, but Counting Sort is not applicable here because the book weights are not discrete integers and we cannot measure the weights precisely to use them as indices. Additionally, it incorrectly claims that the range of values can be determined in O(1) time and that the overall time complexity would be O(n). |
| d2f991_sol011 | 0 | The LLM suggests using Radix sort, but that algorithm is for sorting integers based on their digits. Here, the bravery metric is not quantifiable, thus Radix sort is not applicable. The ground truth suggests a priority queue sort (or selection sort) as the best approach. |
| d2f991_sol012 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies radix sort as an appropriate algorithm but does not mention the key insight that the range of possible values is O(n). Without this observation, it is not clear why radix sort would be preferable to comparison sorts such as merge sort. |
| d2f991_sol013 | 1 | The response gives a valid algorithm for solving the problem. However, it fails to achieve the required O(n^2) time complexity (it's more like O(n^2 log n)). It also doesn't use a hash table as described in the ground truth. |
| d2f991_sol014 | 0 | The LLM's response has a number of major flaws. First, it incorrectly describes how to update the index `i` when traversing up the tree. Specifically, it *adds* the size of the *right* subtree when `v` is a left child (should do nothing), and *subtracts* the size of the *left* subtree when `v` is a right child (should add the size of the left subtree + 1 for the parent node itself). Second, the algorithm does not correctly handle the initial case when v is not the root. The algorithm is entirely wrong. |
| d2f991_sol015 | 0 | The LLM provides a description of the operations a database should support, instead of the database itself. The operations described are also unrelated to those that need to be supported by the database as described in the prompt. |
| d2f991_sol016 | 0 | The response suggests using a Direct Access Array, which is not a balanced search tree as required by the ground truth. This approach does not efficiently solve the problem of finding the active range with the maximum number of active users as it doesn't utilize subtree properties for optimization. |
| e882fl_sol000 | 1 | Partially correct. The answer is correct (False), but the justification is vague and doesn't provide the crucial reason why the statement is false (the exponential growth difference and the impact of constants in exponents). |
| e882fl_sol001 | 0 | The answer is incorrect, and there is no justification provided. The recurrence relation given does not have a solution of O(n^2). |
| e882fl_sol002 | 0 | The answer is wrong, and the justification is incorrect. The justification contradicts the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol003 | 0 | The answer is incorrect and the justification is flawed. While merge sort has O(n log n) time complexity, the justification incorrectly infers that each item is compared with O(log n) other items. The ground truth provides a good counterexample of how a single item can be compared with O(n) items during the merge step. |
| e882fl_sol004 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the answer as false and provides a correct justification that building an AVL tree requires O(nlogn) comparisons, aligning with the ground truth by highlighting the cost of insertion in an AVL tree. |
| e882fl_sol005 | 0 | The answer is incorrect and the justification is wrong. BFS does not detect cycles in directed graphs. |
| e882fl_sol006 | 1 | The answer is incorrect. The justification provides reasoning that would be correct if the statement was "there is a negative-weight cycle reachable from s". However, the ground truth indicates a more nuanced understanding is required, where the witness v may only be reachable from a negative cycle, not necessarily on it. |
| e882fl_sol007 | 2 | The answer is correct and the justification matches the ground truth explanation. |
| e882fl_sol008 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies that Subset Sum is a special case of 0-1 Knapsack and thus if 0-1 Knapsack can be solved in polynomial time, so can Subset Sum. The provided justification is reasonable and aligned with the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol009 | 1 | The answer is correct (False) and the justification is partially correct. It correctly identifies the relationship between pseudopolynomial time and the size of the input numbers. However, it doesn't directly address the ground truth that any polynomial-time algorithm is also a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm, making it only partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol010 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the binary search approach and the initial sorting step. However, it lacks the crucial detail of performing a reachability algorithm (BFS/DFS) within the binary search to check for connectivity, and the binary search time complexity is not properly justified, suggesting O(log|E|) instead of O(|E|log|E|). |
| e882fl_sol011 | 1 | The response provides a dynamic programming approach, but it does not fully align with the ground truth's graph-based DAG relaxation solution. The recurrence relation is not clearly defined and lacks the explicit day constraint. It also does not adequately address the time complexity requirement. |
| e882fl_sol012 | 0 | The response provides an incomplete and incorrect solution based on Dijkstra's algorithm with reweighting. It fails to account for the specific graph structure described in the problem statement (RGB graph with different constraints on edges and vertices) and doesn't correctly utilize the given properties to achieve the required O(|V|) time complexity. It seems to suggest a general solution without leveraging the problem's specific constraints. |
| e882fl_sol013 | 1 | The response provides a general dynamic programming approach which is correct in spirit, but it misses key aspects of the (m,k)-separated subset definition. Specifically, it doesn't enforce the |a-b| >= k constraint. It attempts to initialize a 2D array 'count' but the response is cut off mid-sentence. |
| e882fl_sol014 | 0 | The response provides a high-level description of an algorithm, but it does not align with the dynamic programming approach outlined in the ground truth. The response algorithm seems to be based on iteratively placing guests and minimizing hatred, but it does not correctly account for the monotonicity constraint (favor decreasing away from the queen) nor does it define subproblems recursively. The description is vague and it's unclear how it would find a respectful seating arrangement. Therefore, it is marked as wrong. |
| e882fl_sol015 | 0 | The response provides an algorithm that is fundamentally different and incorrect. It attempts to find a, b, c such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and then checks if d = c exists. This is not the definition of a Pythagorean Quad as given in the problem. Additionally, the complexity analysis is misleading and inaccurate for the proposed algorithm. |
| e882fl_sol016 | 1 | The answer describes a hash table with linked lists for sightings, which is a reasonable starting point. However, it lacks the critical details of the AVL tree for efficient counting within zones and the doubly-linked list for tracking the oldest sightings. The time complexity analysis is also not entirely accurate, particularly regarding remove_oldest() and is_common(). It mentions O(log n) for some operations which is not supported by the data structure they propose. |
| e882fl_sol017 | 1 | The response provides an algorithm that could potentially work. However, it doesn't follow the ground truth in terms of separating the even and odd integers into two separate arrays and then merging them back. It suggests using counting sort or radix sort which could be O(n) but only under specific conditions (e.g., known range of integers). The ground truth is more explicit and general in its use of merge sort and the merge step. The response also incorrectly states that the even integers are in their original positions after sorting, which is not necessarily true. |
| e882fl_sol018 | 0 | The provided answer suggests using an auxiliary array B to count the occurrences of each power value. However, the power values can be as large as n^3, which would require an array B of size n^3, making the algorithm not O(n) time. The proposed algorithm has a fundamental flaw because it requires O(n^3) memory. |
| f1c1b2_sol000 | 2 | The response correctly describes a DFS algorithm to count the number of blobs in an image with O(nm) time complexity. It accurately outlines the steps involved, including marking visited pixels and recursively exploring neighbors. The pseudocode provides a clear representation of the algorithm's implementation, aligning well with the ground truth. |
| f1c1b2_sol001 | 0 | The LLM suggests Dijkstra's algorithm, which does not run in O(|V|) time. The LLM also does not take into account the specific properties of the graph (undirected, connected, |E| = |V|) to optimize the algorithm. |
| f1c1b2_sol002 | 0 | The response fails to provide a correct algorithm for finding the shortest path avoiding doughnut shops within a given distance. The approach of adding vertices for doughnut shops and modifying edge weights is incorrect and does not align with the ground truth's method of constructing a subgraph without vertices near doughnut shops. The response also includes an irrelevant step of adding an extra vertex for the power plant. |
| f1c1b2_sol003 | 1 | The response proposes using Floyd-Warshall, which is not aligned with the ground truth's approach of using a modified Bellman-Ford. It identifies the dynamic programming aspect correctly but doesn't implement the exact steps to solve the problem as efficiently as the ground truth does. |
| f2e771_sol000 | 0 | The LLM response suggests using a dynamic array, which is not O(1) for removing a customer from anywhere in the array (other than the end), or finding the position of a customer (as the prompt requests). The LLM response does not mention a hash table, which is required to achieve O(1) lookup time for removal and seating. |
| f2e771_sol001 | 1 | The answer uses a BBST, but does not correctly describe how to augment the tree for efficient peak rainfall queries. It also does not adequately describe how to incorporate latitude into the data structure. Therefore, it is only partially correct. |
| mit6_3_sol000 | 0 | The response is incorrect; it labels the problem as pseudopolynomial when the ground truth indicates it is polynomial. |
| mit6_3_sol001 | 2 | The answer matches the ground truth exactly. |
| mit6_3_sol002 | 0 | The answer is incorrect, as the correct answer is Polynomial but the response provided Pseudopolynomial. |
| mit6_3_sol003 | 1 | The LLM response presents a general approach using dynamic programming, but the recurrence relation it provides,  `x(i) = \max_{p \in P} \{x(i - |p|) + v(p)\}`, is not correct for this problem. This recurrence assumes that each playable word `p` must start at index 0 of the array T, which is not the case in the problem statement. The problem requires finding non-overlapping subarrays (substrings) anywhere within T. Also, it doesn't create a hash table to improve lookup time. Thus, the response is only partially correct. |
| mit6_3_sol004 | 1 | The LLM response presents a dynamic programming approach which is relevant to the ground truth, specifically mentioning the creation of a 2D array to store results of subproblems, akin to the ground truth's description of subproblems xa(i, k) and xB(i, k). However, there are significant differences in the details. The LLM's logic of checking `dp[i-1][j-A[i]] or dp[i-1][j-B[i]]` for the possibility of a sum is not entirely accurate for a 'limited-unlimited' sequence. It doesn't properly account for the 'limited' aspect of set A (each element can be used at most once) or the 'unlimited' aspect of set B (each element can be used multiple times). The ground truth gives recursive relations which are more correct. The LLM response also does not specify the final step of checking `OR{AND{xa(0, k), xB(0, m − k)}}`. So the response is only partially correct. |
| mit6_3_sol005 | 0 | The provided response does not align with the ground truth solution. It describes a greedy approach that doesn't guarantee an optimal or even feasible solution. It fails to define appropriate subproblems, relationships, base cases, topological order, and original problem as outlined in the ground truth dynamic programming solution. The described algorithm is also not guaranteed to run in O(n^3) time. The response also lacks the necessary rigor and structure for a dynamic programming solution. |
