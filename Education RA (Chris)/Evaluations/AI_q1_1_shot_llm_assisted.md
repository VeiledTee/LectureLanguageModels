## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q1_0 | 2 | The LLM response accurately explains why alpha-beta pruning cannot be generalized to do a breadth-first exploration of the game tree while maintaining optimality. It correctly identifies the incompatibility of BFS with the pruning mechanism and the benefits of DFS in this context. The answer also mentions the memory usage and performance considerations, further strengthening its explanation. |
| q1_1 | 2 | The LLM response correctly explains that alpha-beta can be generalized to perform progressive deepening and still get the optimal answer. It accurately describes the advantages and disadvantages of using progressive-deepening search in this application, including time management, move ordering, and the trade-off of revisiting nodes. The response is well-structured and provides a clear explanation of the concept and its implications. |
| q1_2 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly identifies Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS), also known as Progressive Deepening (PD), as the best algorithm. The explanation is accurate and provides a good rationale for using IDDFS and under what conditions a visited list would be beneficial. |
| q1_3 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies Uniform Cost Search as the appropriate algorithm and explains its use in finding the optimal path. It also correctly suggests the use of a visited list to prevent re-exploration of states. The explanation is clear and well-reasoned, matching the key points of the ground truth. |
| q1_4 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that full constraint propagation does not change the domains of the variables, which all remain {R, B}. |
| q1_5 | 2 | The LLM provides a fully correct answer, matching the ground truth exactly. The reasoning is also correct and well-explained. |
| q1_6 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies the domains of variables 1, 2, and 4 after forward checking. However, it incorrectly narrows down the domains of variables 3 and 5 to {R} instead of {R, B}. |
| q1_7 | 0 | The response doesn't provide the answer in the requested format. It should have marked the search tree directly, putting check marks and crosses in the correct places, which it fails to do. |
| q1_8 | 0 | The answer is completely wrong and does not match the ground truth at all. It completely misses the backtracking steps and gets the wrong variable assignments. |
| q1_9 | 2 | The LLM output is fully correct and aligns with the ground truth. The sequence of assignments and the domain updates are accurate. The explanation is also correct and reflects the backtracking with forward checking and dynamic variable ordering. |
| q1_10 | 0 | The LLM is completely wrong. The domain size is not m*n and it misinterprets which constraints are satisfied and which are not. Also, it incorrectly assesses whether the constraints can be expressed as binary constraints. No part of the answer is correct. |
| q1_11 | 2 | The LLM's answer completely matches the ground truth. It correctly states that the domain size is m*n + 1. The LLM explains its reasoning clearly and accurately. |
| q1_12 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies that constraint C2 is automatically satisfied in formulation A. The explanation is clear and accurate. |
| q1_13 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that C1 cannot be expressed as a binary constraint and accurately explains how C3 can be modeled as a binary constraint. |
| q1_14 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that the domain for each scientist is the set of all possible pairs of observations from their list. It also provides a clear and correct mathematical representation of the domain. |
| q1_15 | 1 | The LLM response incorrectly states that the number of possible assignments is m * (n choose 2). The problem asks for the domain size of each scientist, so it should not depend on m. |
| q1_16 | 2 | The answer is fully correct. It accurately identifies that constraint C1 is satisfied by construction in Formulation B, and correctly states why. |
| q1_17 | 0 | The LLM answer states binary constraints are challenging and largely cannot be done. The ground truth states that binary constraints are possible for C2 and C3. |
| q1_18 | 0 | The ground truth states that the domain for each request is {Granted, Rejected}, but the LLM response says that the domain for each variable consists of potential assignments of each observation request to time slots and instruments subject to the constraints C1, C2, and C3. This is incorrect. |
| q1_19 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct, matching the ground truth exactly. |
| q1_20 | 0 | The response incorrectly claims that constraint C1 is necessarily satisfied. The variables are the scientists' requests, so no constraints are automatically satisfied. |
| q1_21 | 1 | The answer correctly states that C2 can be expressed as binary constraints. However, the ground truth states C3 can be expressed as binary constraints, whereas the response claims that C3 can't be expressed as binary constraints. |
| q1_22 | 1 | The LLM includes the types of rocks already collected, current rover location, current battery charge level, and total weight of collected rocks, all of which are in the ground truth. It also includes 'Distance to lander' and 'Time since last charged' which are not in the ground truth, and is missing 'time since departure from lander', making it only partially correct. |
| q1_23 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies all three conditions required for the goal test: all rock types collected, rover at the lander, and within the time limit. |
| q1_24 | 1 | The answer is partially correct because the 'move' action is well defined. Also, the 'pick-up-rock' and 'charge' actions are similar to the ground truth with more verbose descriptions. However, a few key details are missing from each action (e.g. incrementing time for charging or updating rock collection for pick-up). Hence, partially correct. |
| q1_25 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the key components of the cost function for each action. However, the ground truth implies simpler, more direct answers. The move cost only says proportional to distance (meters per move). The answer includes battery consumption and time taken, when the prompt only asks to consider distance travelled. |
| q1_26 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the admissibility of H3 but fails to correctly identify the admissibility of H1 and practicality of H2. It hallucinates the consistency criteria. |
| q1_27 | 0 | The algorithm identified by the LLM (DFS) is incorrect. The ground truth identifies BFS. All other fields are incorrect as they are dependent on the algorithm used. |
| q1_28 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect. The heuristic is also incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. |
| q1_29 | 1 | The algorithm is correctly identified as A* Search. However, the heuristic is incorrectly identified as H2 instead of H1. The explanation of why the least-cost path wasn't found is partially correct in that it identifies the potential for a non-optimal path, but it incorrectly attributes it to H2 and also mentions consistency when admissibility is the key issue here. |
| q1_30 | 1 | The algorithm is misidentified as A* search instead of Best First Search. The heuristic is correctly identified as H2. The optimality is correctly identified, but the reasoning is based on the incorrect algorithm. |
| q1_31 | 0 | The algorithm is identified incorrectly. Therefore, the justification is also wrong. |
| q1_32 | 0 | The algorithm is incorrect, the heuristic is incorrect, and the reasoning about the path is incorrect. The entire answer is wrong. |
| q1_33 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct as it correctly identifies the algorithm as Uniform Cost Search, states that no heuristic is used, and explains why the algorithm finds the least-cost path. The reasoning aligns with the ground truth. |
