|-------------|-------|----------|
| 156473_sol000 | 1 | The LLM response provides a dynamic programming algorithm with a recurrence relation that is similar to the ground truth. However, the subproblem definition is slightly different, and the LLM response doesn't fully capture the constraints of the problem (at most twice in any seven day period). The time complexity is correctly identified as O(n) but the logic and subproblem defintions are not fully matching ground truth. |
| 156473_sol001 | 1 | The response misses key elements from the ground truth such as the formal definition of the subproblems, their relations, topological ordering, base cases, and the original problem's solution within the subproblem framework. The response describes a DP approach which is on the right track, but its recurrence relation and overall structure do not fully align with the ground truth's more detailed and accurate method. The time complexity analysis is correct, but this is a minor part of the overall solution. |
| 156473_sol002 | 1 | The LLM response provides a dynamic programming approach, which is correct. It correctly identifies the dependencies between subproblems and the overall time complexity. However, the subproblem definition and recurrence relation is not as clear and concise as the ground truth. The base cases are also not explicitly defined. Therefore, it is partially correct. |
| 156473_sol003 | 1 | The LLM response presents a dynamic programming approach which aligns with the ground truth. However, the subproblems are not properly defined and the recurrence relation is not completely accurate, leading to partially correct categorization. The topo sort idea is also present. |
| 20ec72_sol000 | 1 | The approach uses dynamic programming to find the minimum weight of paths from v to all other nodes u with exactly i edges. The base case and subproblem relation are correctly defined. However, the final step of finding the minimum weight cycle is not correct and is inefficient. The time complexity is O(|V|k|E|) which is stated as O(k|E|) because |V| <= |E|. Overall, partially correct. |
| 20ec72_sol001 | 1 | The response suggests a dynamic programming-esque approach, which is valid. However, the implementation is vague and the complexity analysis is incorrect. The graph construction approach in the ground truth is more efficient. The response receives partial credit. |
| 20ec72_sol002 | 0 | The response attempts to find the shortest path but the approach is flawed. The construction of the graph is incorrect. The resulting algorithm is not O(k) as required. |
| 20ec72_sol003 | 0 | The response does not provide a correct algorithm to solve the problem. The ground truth uses bellman ford to find negative weight cycles and then constructs a new graph to count the number of connected components, each of which corresponds to a negative weight cycle. The LLM response has a bunch of notation that is not clear and the algorithm is not correct. |
| 20ec72_sol004 | 0 | The LLM provides a very high-level approach that does not solve the problem, failing to provide critical details of the solution (e.g., how the graph is constructed, edge weights, use of potentials). Dijkstra is mentioned without justification, where it is not clear how negative edge weights are handled. |
| d2f991_sol000 | 0 | The provided answer is incorrect. The worst-case time complexity for frequentest1 is O(n+k), which the LLM correctly identifies. However, the worst-case time complexity for frequentest2 is O(n), not O(n*k). The dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) have an average time complexity of O(1), and in the worst case, with many collisions it could be O(n), but not O(n*k). The final 'return' statement requires iterating through the dictionary (at most n items), making it O(n). The provided ground truth is O(n^2) which is also incorrect. |
| d2f991_sol001 | 2 | The LLM response correctly states that the expected running time for both functions is O(n). |
| d2f991_sol002 | 0 | The ground truth is O(n + k). The LLM response provides two different answers. The first is O(n*k) which is wrong. The second is O(n) which is also wrong. |
| d2f991_sol003 | 0 | The response is entirely incorrect. The expected running time is O(n+k) for both algorithms but the response states O(n) for both. |
| d2f991_sol004 | 2 | The answer is fully correct. It correctly identifies 'A' as the item with the smallest integer in a min-heap. |
| d2f991_sol005 | 1 | The response is partially correct. It includes some of the correct items (D,E), but misses other valid items and includes an incorrect one (C). |
| d2f991_sol006 | 1 | The response identifies some of the correct answers (H, I, and J), but misses F and G. |
| d2f991_sol007 | 0 | The provided answer is completely wrong. It does not match the ground truth array representation of the heap before or after the delete_max() operation. The 'before' and 'after' states are both incorrect based on the problem description. |
| d2f991_sol008 | 0 | The provided answer does not match the ground truth at all. The ground truth is (17, 85, 11, 13), while the answer is (17, 6, 11). Therefore, the response is considered wrong. |
| d2f991_sol009 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies counting sort as the most efficient sorting algorithm and provides a valid justification based on the range of friend numbers and the time complexity. The answer correctly mentions linear time complexity. |
| d2f991_sol010 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies the need for a comparison sort and justifies it by explaining that the scale provides comparisons. It also correctly identifies merge sort as an appropriate algorithm with O(n log n) complexity, matching the ground truth. |
| d2f991_sol011 | 1 | The LLM response suggests using Selection Sort, which aligns with the ground truth mentioning a selection-based approach (priority queue sort by finding the maximum). However, the LLM response states the time complexity is O(n^2) dominated by O(n) bravery computations repeated. This is incorrect. Since the Sorting Sock can find the bravest student in O(1) time, selection sort can be done in O(n) time, matching the ground truth's optimal O(n) time complexity. The method is correct, but the time complexity analysis is wrong. |
| d2f991_sol012 | 1 | The answer suggests counting sort which is reasonable given the constraints but does not provide enough justification as to why it's the most efficient. The ground truth suggests radix sort which is more efficient in this case. |
| d2f991_sol013 | 1 | The response provides the correct idea of hashing sums of two arrays and then checking for the negation in the third array. It also mentions the correct time complexity. However, it hashes B and C instead of A and B as in the ground truth, which while still correct, deviates. The response also omits a formal correctness argument. Because of these deviations and omissions, I mark it as partially correct. |
| d2f991_sol014 | 1 | The response outlines a correct approach by traversing up the tree and considering left subtree sizes. However, it lacks the detailed breakdown of cases (left child vs. right child) and the explicit formula for updating the count as outlined in the ground truth. It also doesn't explicitly state the base case for the recursion or iteration. |
| d2f991_sol015 | 1 | The response suggests using dictionaries to store the hole information, which is a reasonable approach. However, it doesn't fully capture the data structures and algorithms needed for efficiently finding and patching holes according to the priority scheme, especially regarding the Min Heap and the management of hole pairs for calculating minimum distances. The time complexity analysis is also not as precise as it should be, and the explanation could be clearer. |
| d2f991_sol016 | 1 | The response proposes using a balanced BST and x-priority search trees, which are valid data structures. However, it lacks the detailed augmentation properties (size, suffix, prefix, substring) described in the ground truth. The time complexity analysis is also vague and doesn't align with the O(log n) efficiency achievable with the augmented tree approach. Therefore, it's only partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol000 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false and gives a correct justification about the difference in growth rates of exponential functions with different bases. |
| e882fl_sol001 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false. However, there is a typo in the provided equation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n^2, which differs from the original problem's equation. While the reasoning about the growth rate being \(\Theta(n^2 \log n)\) is relevant to a similar recurrence, it's not directly applicable to the original problem. The justification mentions 'BST' which is unclear in this context. Therefore, it is partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol002 | 1 | The answer is correct, but the justification is not precise. The amortized cost is O(1) per operation across n operations, guaranteeing O(n) total time, but the justification implies some operations could take O(n) time. |
| e882fl_sol003 | 1 | The answer is false but the justification is not precise. It correctly identifies merge sort as a comparison-based method with \(\Omega(n \log n)\) comparisons, which means on average \(\Omega(\log n)\) per item, but this is an average case analysis and the question asks if each item is compared with O(log n) items, which is not true in worst case, for example, in the final merge step between two sorted halves. |
| e882fl_sol004 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as False and provides a valid justification based on the comparison complexity of building an AVL tree. |
| e882fl_sol005 | 1 | The answer is False, which is correct. The justification is not as thorough as the ground truth but it highlights the key issue that a processed neighbor doesn't necessarily indicate a cycle. |
| e882fl_sol006 | 0 | The answer is wrong and the justification is wrong. The justification attempts to reason about path lengths but doesn't accurately reflect the Bellman-Ford algorithm's behavior or the condition for a witness. |
| e882fl_sol007 | 0 | The LLM answer contradicts the ground truth. It claims Johnson's algorithm is \(O(|V|^2 \log |V|)\) for complete graphs, which is incorrect. It seems to have missed that |E| = Θ(|V|^2) in the second term of Johnson's algorithm's complexity, making it \(O(|V|^3)\) as well. |
| e882fl_sol008 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies that subset sum is a special case of 0-1 Knapsack with equal weights and values, and concludes that a polynomial algorithm for 0-1 Knapsack would solve Subset Sum, matching the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol009 | 1 | The answer is correct (False). The justification mentions pseudopolynomial time ('P'') and polynomial time, indicating some understanding, but it doesn't directly address the core reason why the statement is false (a problem can have both a pseudopolynomial-time and a polynomial-time algorithm). |
| e882fl_sol010 | 1 | The answer is partially correct because it provides the general idea of sorting and using connected components, but it does not provide the detail of binary search as in the ground truth to achieve the required time complexity. The time complexity is also not explicitly discussed. Sorting is mentioned, and the idea of maintaining connected components is present, but the crucial binary search for optimization is missing. |
| e882fl_sol011 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies the need for a graph representation where nodes are (city, day) pairs. It also mentions the shortest path idea. However, it suggests using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is not the most efficient approach for a DAG. While Dijkstra's would work, it is not O(nd) time. The ground truth suggests DAG Relaxation, which is more suitable for acyclic graphs and achieves the required time complexity. The response also has an incorrect weight assignment. Edge "(c_i, k) -> (c_j, k+1)" should have weight "g(c_i, c_j) + h(c_j)" instead of "h(c_i) + g(c_i, c_j)". Also, path needs to reach node (Fan Sancrisco, d') for d' in 0...d |
| e882fl_sol012 | 0 | The response does not present a correct O(|V|) algorithm to compute the minimum weight path from s to t. The proposed algorithm is unclear and does not align with the ground truth's approach of using BFS and Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford in stages based on the coloring properties of the graph. It attempts a BFS-like traversal, but the details are vague and nonsensical (e.g., "metta.subvot"). There is no clear connection to the specific constraints of the problem. |
| e882fl_sol013 | 1 | The LLM provides an idea of using a number line and iteratively updating counts, which has some resemblance to dynamic programming principles relevant to the ground truth. However, the description is vague and lacks the specifics of defining subproblems, recurrence relation, base cases, and topological ordering as outlined in the ground truth. The explanation regarding the O(n^2m) time complexity is also not clear. Therefore, it can only be considered partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol014 | 0 | The LLM response presents an entirely different approach that does not align with the ground truth's dynamic programming formulation. It incorrectly identifies the problem as a sequence alignment variant and provides a recurrence relation that doesn't accurately capture the problem's constraints or structure. The proposed algorithm would not produce a correct solution. |
| e882fl_sol015 | 1 | The response attempts to solve the problem but fails to provide a correct O(n^2) algorithm. The approach of checking if sums of squares are squares is not directly related to finding a Pythagorean Quad of the form d = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). The algorithm's correctness is questionable and the explanation of the time complexity is not clear. |
| e882fl_sol016 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the need for a doubly-linked list and a hash table. It correctly uses the doubly-linked list to maintain the order of sightings and the hash table to maintain counts. However, the response uses a secondary fixed-size hash table which is incorrect. It fails to specify using an AVL tree. Overall, the response is partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol017 | 1 | The response suggests removing even integers and inserting them which is vaguely in the correct direction but misses details of correctly sorting the even numbers and merging. |
| e882fl_sol018 | 1 | The solution suggests using radix sort directly on the powers. However, the power values can be up to 2n^4 (since x and y are less than n^2), and thus the radix sort wouldn't be O(n). The approach suggested by the ground truth, splitting the array into two parts A1 and A2 is more reasonable to achieve O(n). |
| f1c1b2_sol000 | 1 | The LLM response correctly describes the flood fill algorithm and mentions that it can be implemented using DFS or BFS, achieving the desired O(nm) time complexity. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the graph-based approach outlined in the ground truth, which is a key aspect of the reference solution. Therefore, it's only partially correct. |
| f1c1b2_sol001 | 1 | The response incorrectly claims that if |E| = |V| for a connected graph, G is a tree. G has one cycle if |E|=|V|. The rest of the solution is correct, assuming G is a tree, so it is partially correct. |
| f1c1b2_sol002 | 1 | The response constructs a road graph. Precomputes shortest path distances d(v, u) from every node v to any doughnut shop. Removes any vertex v from G for which d(v, u) \leq k. Uses Dijkstra to find shortest path in modified graph from p to h. However, it suggests using multi-source breadth-first search which would take O(nd) time which could be O(n^2) rather than O(n) since d could be O(n). The ground truth suggests running dijkstra which is more efficient. |
| f1c1b2_sol003 | 1 | The response correctly describes the Bellman-Ford-like approach to compute the minimum weight path with exactly k edges, and provides the correct recurrence. However, it fails to consider the second part of the algorithm, which is to compute the minimum weight path from v to t using any number of edges. Also, the recurrence is slightly off, it should not have the d(v, k-1) term since we want to find a path with *exactly* k edges. |
| f2e771_sol000 | 1 | The answer describes the correct data structures (hash table and doubly linked list), and mentions the correct runtimes for add_customer and cancel. However, the response omits the fact that the hash table time complexity is amortized. The description of seat_next_customer does not match the ground truth: the ground truth solution removes a specific customer name x from the front of the line, while the LLM response removes the next customer in line. This is a significant difference, so the response is only partially correct. |
| f2e771_sol001 | 1 | The response describes a database using BSTs (unbalanced), and augmented with max_r. It also describes the operations in question. The response does not account for the time complexity of these operations given the possibility of unbalanced trees, thus only partially correct. |
| mit6_3_sol000 | 0 | The answer is completely wrong. None of the answers match the ground truth. |
| mit6_3_sol001 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the correct classification for problem (4) as pseudopolynomial. Problems (3) and (5) are not present in the ground truth and therefore do not detract from the partial credit awarded. |
| mit6_3_sol002 | 0 | The response does not match the ground truth. The response includes answers for problems (3), (4) and (5) while the ground truth only contains the correct answer to problem (5) and also does not provide the answer in the correct format. The answer to problem (5) also does not match the ground truth. |
| mit6_3_sol003 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies the need for dynamic programming and mentions using a trie which can be a valid approach to check if a substring is a playable word. However, it lacks some details provided in the ground truth such as hash table construction and how the trie data structure helps achieve O(m) complexity. Also, the topological ordering and base case are not clearly defined. |
| mit6_3_sol004 | 1 | The response uses a graph-based approach which is not in the ground truth. Although the idea of considering whether to include an element from A or B is present, the graph construction and BFS algorithm aren't a standard dynamic programming approach described in the ground truth. The complexity analysis is vaguely correct, but the reasoning is tied to the non-DP approach. |
| mit6_3_sol005 | 1 | The response does not present the correct dynamic programming algorithm and related analyses as described in the ground truth. While it does provide some intuition about the problem and attempts to use max flow, the approach is not correct and misses the core dynamic programming structure needed for an O(n^3) time complexity. Therefore, it's only partially correct. |
