## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q1_0 | 2 | The response correctly states that alpha-beta cannot be generalized to breadth-first search and still get the optimal answer. The reason provided is also in line with the ground truth, that alpha-beta relies on knowing the best value for a node to prune. |
| q1_1 | 1 | The response correctly identifies that progressive deepening can be used with alpha-beta search to get the optimal answer. However, it describes an incorrect implementation of alpha-beta with progressive deepening and mentions an advantage but does not mention the most important advantage that a reasonable move is always available in timed situations. Therefore, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q1_2 | 1 | The answer suggests Depth-Limited Search instead of Progressive Deepening, but the overall strategy is similar in spirit to the ground truth answer. It mentions cycle detection which is related to avoiding visited lists, but not quite the same. Therefore, it's partially correct. |
| q1_3 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies Uniform Cost Search as the appropriate algorithm given the variable costs. However, it incorrectly describes when expanded/visited lists would be a good idea; it describes scenarios involving uniform additive step costs, when the ground truth says that an expanded list is useful to prevent re-exploration of states, especially if the search space contains loops, regardless of whether costs are uniform. Therefore, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q1_4 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that full constraint propagation will not change the domains of the variables. The explanation provided is also accurate. |
| q1_5 | 0 | The answer is incorrect. The colors are flipped. The ground truth states: 1 = {B}, 2 = {R}, 3 = {B}, 4 = {R}, 5 = {B}. The provided answer states: Variable 1 has domain {R}. Variable 2 has domain {B}. Variable 3 has domain {R}. Variable 4 has domain {B}. Variable 5 has domain {B}. |
| q1_6 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct; it correctly identifies the domains of variables 2, 3, 4, and 5 after assigning variable 1 to R and performing forward checking. It matches all the domain values in the ground truth. |
| q1_7 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the initial steps of backtracking, including the assignment of variables 1 and 2 and the initial failure with variable 5. However, it does not comprehensively simulate the entire backtracking process as visualized in the tree, specifically not detailing how it would proceed after the initial failure with variable 5 and subsequent backtracking. Because of this, it only partially captures the full solution implied by the ground truth, which involved marking the entire search tree according to BT rules. |
| q1_8 | 0 | The LLM fails to correctly simulate the BT-FC algorithm, particularly how it backtracks when a domain becomes empty. The assignment sequence provided is completely wrong; it misses backtracking steps and incorrectly assigns values without considering domain restrictions. |
| q1_9 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the sequence of variable assignments using backtracking with forward checking and dynamic variable ordering (most-constrained-variable strategy). The assignments are: 5=B, 2=R, 1=B, 3=B, 4=R, which matches the ground truth exactly. |
| q1_10 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. The ground truth mentions that for each instrument/time slot, the domain is the set of observations requesting that instrument/time slot plus an 'empty' value, while the LLM response omits mentioning the 'empty' value. |
| q1_11 | 1 | The answer is partially correct, but it doesn't quite get to the domain size being m*n + 1. It correctly identifies that the domain size will depend on the number of observations that request the relevant instrument and time slot, and it also identifies that this is a large number proportional to m*n. However, it misses the "+ 1" which accounts for the possibility of not scheduling anything in that slot. |
| q1_12 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that constraint C2 is automatically satisfied in Formulation A. |
| q1_13 | 1 | The LLM correctly says C1 cannot be expressed as a binary constraint. However, it does not address C3, making the answer partially correct. |
| q1_14 | 2 | The LLM's response is fully correct and matches the ground truth. |
| q1_15 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly identifies the size of the domain as the number of ways to choose 2 observations from n requests, which is (n choose 2) or n(n-1)/2, which is approximately n^2/2. |
| q1_16 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies that constraint C1 is satisfied. |
| q1_17 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly states that the constraints cannot be specified as binary constraints, and provides a faulty justification. The ground truth states that they can be. |
| q1_18 | 1 | The answer is partially correct because it uses {0, 1} instead of {Granted, Rejected}. While both are binary and functionally similar, the ground truth specifies the latter. |
| q1_19 | 0 | The correct answer is 2, but the response is mn. So it is wrong. |
| q1_20 | 2 | The response perfectly matches the ground truth. |
| q1_21 | 1 | The response only partially matches the ground truth. It correctly identifies that C1 cannot be specified as a binary constraint. It misses that C2 and C3 can be expressed as binary constraints. |
| q1_22 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It includes 4 of the 5 variables in the ground truth but also introduces a variable 'total distance traveled' that is not in the ground truth. |
| q1_23 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies that the goal is reached when the rover has collected one of each type of rock and is back at the lander, but it fails to mention the time constraint (elapsed time less than three days). |
| q1_24 | 1 | The response is partially correct. It correctly identifies the "charge" and "pick-up-rock" actions, although the preconditions and effects are not perfectly aligned with the ground truth. The "move" action is also present, but again with slight deviations in preconditions and effects. The fourth action, "Stop by lander and call it a day," is not present in the ground truth, but the other actions are present and mostly correct. |
| q1_25 | 1 | The LLM provides some relevant insights into cost functions, but the response does not directly match the ground truth answers. The LLM introduces some strategies which are not required in the answer, and misses details in the ground truth answer (e.g. charge cost is 0). |
| q1_26 | 1 | H1 correctly identifies that it is not admissible. H2's explanation is incorrect. H3 correctly identifies that it is admissible but weak. |
| q1_27 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect. Breadth-first search expands nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges. This contrasts with depth-first search. Hence, the entire response is wrong. |
| q1_28 | 0 | The algorithm predicted is incorrect (Depth-first instead of Best First Search). Consequently, the heuristic is also marked as None instead of H1. The reasoning about DFS not being optimal is correct but irrelevant given the incorrect algorithm identification. |
| q1_29 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly identifies the algorithm and heuristic. The reasoning about why a least-cost path wasn't found is generally correct for the chosen algorithm but incorrect in the context of the actual correct answer (A* search with an inadmissible heuristic). |
| q1_30 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the algorithm and the heuristic used. However, it incorrectly claims that the search did not find the least-cost path and provides a wrong reason. Ground truth claims it did find the least cost path. |
| q1_31 | 2 | The LLM's response perfectly matches the ground truth, correctly identifying the algorithm, heuristic, and optimality of the path. |
| q1_32 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect. The path A->B->D->C->G with cost 9 is found, but A* with heuristic H2 would find the least-cost path A->D->C->G with cost 5. Uniform cost search would find the same least-cost path. Therefore, the algorithm is incorrect, and the justification for not finding the least-cost path is also incorrect, as uniform cost search would have found it with or without a strict expanded list. |
| q1_33 | 1 | The algorithm and heuristic are correctly identified. However, the explanation for why the least-cost path was/was not found is incorrect, according to the ground truth. Uniform cost search with a strict expanded list does not prevent it from finding the optimal path. The ground truth specifies it did find the optimal path. |
