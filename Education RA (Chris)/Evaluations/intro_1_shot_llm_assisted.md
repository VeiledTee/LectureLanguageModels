| 156473_sol000 | 1 | The LLM response outlines a general dynamic programming approach but does not fully capture the nuances required for an O(n) solution as described in the ground truth. The response suggests a recurrence relation and mentions handling the 7-day constraint with pre-computed sums, but it lacks the precise definition of subproblems (x(i,j)), the detailed recurrence relation considering the next allowable play, and specific base cases as present in the ground truth. It misses defining and leveraging the x(i,j) subproblems, which are crucial for achieving O(n) time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations. Therefore, while the response identifies the core DP strategy, it's incomplete and doesn't fully align with the specifics of the ground truth's O(n) algorithm. |
| 156473_sol001 | 1 | The solution is mostly correct, but the recurrence relation is wrong. It does not account for the case where we skip a character in either Alice or Bob's DNA. Also, the DP table is defined incorrectly, it should be 4D, not 3D as in the ground truth, and the algorithm is not O(n^4) because of this error. Also, the final check is incorrect as it only returns true if the two DNA subsequences match using all of Charlie's DNA. |
| 156473_sol002 | 2 | The response is fully correct and matches the ground truth, describing the dynamic programming solution accurately with correct base cases, state transitions, and complexity analysis. |
| 156473_sol003 | 1 | The solution uses dynamic programming. While it captures the overall idea, the state definition `dp[i]` only tracks the minimum cost to catch monsters up to `m_i`, which is insufficient for solving the problem since one needs to keep track of *where* Kash is. The recurrence relation therefore is incorrect as well. The algorithm provided also does not account for the possibility of purchasing monsters along the way from locations besides the most recently visited monster location. Time complexity is correct but that is not enough for a fully correct categorization. |
| 20ec72_sol000 | 1 | The response provides a dynamic programming approach which can solve the problem. The time complexity is correctly analyzed as O(k|E|). However, it is difficult to see how DP[i][j] can be stored as the minimum weight of a path that *starts and ends* at v, as it should only end at i. It also fails to construct a new graph to facilitate the dynamic programming as the ground truth answer does. Thus, it is only partially correct. |
| 20ec72_sol001 | 1 | The LLM answer is only partially correct. It correctly identifies the need to construct a new graph with color-coded vertices and using Dijkstra's algorithm. However, there are inaccuracies in how the new graph G' is constructed, particularly concerning the edges between color-coded vertices. The algorithm doesn't accurately reflect the additional cost w_c for color changes, so the edge creation step is flawed. It also fails to explicitly detail the need to run SSSP from each color of the source node. Because it misses key components of the algorithm, the time complexity is also incorrect. |
| 20ec72_sol002 | 0 | The response suggests using Dijkstra's algorithm which has a time complexity of O(E log V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.  In this problem, the number of edges is 3n, and the number of vertices is n.  Therefore, Dijkstra's algorithm would have a time complexity of O(3n log n) = O(n log n).  Since k >= n, this can be written as O(k log k).  This is not O(k).  Furthermore, it suggests using a Fibonacci heap, which has a decrease key operation in O(1) time.  However, Fibonacci heaps are notoriously slow in practice due to the overhead of maintaining the heap structure.  The ground truth constructs a new graph with k vertices and then uses BFS, which is O(k + E) = O(k + 5n + k) = O(k) since k >= n.  Furthermore, the ground truth correctly argues why the new graph preserves the number of orks. |
| 20ec72_sol003 | 1 | The response uses Floyd-Warshall, which runs in O(V^3) as required. However, the description for how to count the cycles after running Floyd-Warshall is not fully correct as it does not address the key property of cycle-sparse graphs (that each vertex is reachable from at most one negative-weight cycle). Therefore, it's only partially correct. |
| 20ec72_sol004 | 1 | The LLM response misses crucial re-weighting step to ensure positive edge weights for Dijkstra to work. It also neglects the mg(h(b) – h(a)) factor which arises from the re-weighting step. It incorrectly states that it maximizes instead of minimizing a quantity, which is incorrect. The algorithm described is incorrect since it will not return the proper value. |
| d2f991_sol000 | 0 | The LLM response provides an answer of O(n+k), while the ground truth is O(n²). This indicates that the LLM response is wrong. |
| d2f991_sol001 | 1 | The LLM provides the correct expected runtime for the first function, but it fails to mention the ground truth expected runtime for the second function. So, I marked the answer as partially correct. |
| d2f991_sol002 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. The function using an array of size k is correctly analyzed as O(n+k). However, the function using a dictionary is incorrectly analyzed as O(n). The step of finding the most frequent integer from the dictionary is O(n) where n is the number of unique elements, so it's still O(n) since the input array is of size n in total. |
| d2f991_sol003 | 1 | The answer provides an expected run time of O(n) for the dict approach, while the ground truth only provides O(n+k) which is for the counting array approach. It does correctly identify the runtime for the counting array. |
| d2f991_sol004 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. The correct answer is A and the explanation clearly states why. |
| d2f991_sol005 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies B and C as possible locations but fails to include D, E, F, and G. Thus, the answer is partially correct. |
| d2f991_sol006 | 1 | The response is partially correct as it identifies H, I, and J as possible locations for the largest integer, but misses F and G, which are also leaf nodes in the min-heap. |
| d2f991_sol007 | 0 | The response gives a very generic explanation of max-heap and delete_max operation, but doesn't state the correct array representations before and after the operation, as it was expected. The response provides a conceptual walkthrough instead of a specific answer. |
| d2f991_sol008 | 0 | The LLM's answer is incorrect. The correct answer is (17,85, 11, 13), but the LLM answers (17, 63, 11). It fails to perform the correct tree transformations and therefore obtains the wrong values in the traversal order. Also, it states a wrong explanation of how AVL trees work. |
| d2f991_sol009 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies counting sort as the most efficient sorting algorithm in this scenario. It also correctly states the time complexity as O(n+k). It also notes that friend number for each student is an integer value determined in \(O(1)\) time, and can be considered as a small integer if the number of students (n) is not excessively large. |
| d2f991_sol010 | 2 | The response correctly identifies that a comparison sort is needed and suggests merge sort as an option. It also correctly states the O(nlogn) time complexity. |
| d2f991_sol011 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies that selection sort is the most efficient sorting algorithm given the ability to find the bravest student in O(1) time. The explanation and reasoning are also correct and align with the ground truth. |
| d2f991_sol012 | 1 | The LLM answer correctly identifies that the problem involves sorting students based on a numeric attribute (magical lineage). However, it fails to recognize the crucial constraint that the range of possible values for magical lineage is limited to O(n). Because of this constraint, a more efficient sorting algorithm like radix sort (O(n)) can be used instead of general-purpose sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort (O(n log n)). The response mentions these O(n log n) algorithms, and makes no mention of the O(n) radix sort described in the ground truth. Thus the response is only partially correct. |
| d2f991_sol013 | 2 | The response provides a correct algorithm with the required time complexity. It correctly explains how the set data structure contributes to the O(n^2) time complexity. |
| d2f991_sol014 | 1 | The LLM response provides a correct general strategy of traversing up the tree and accumulating the sizes of left subtrees when the node is a right child. However, the algorithm incorrectly adds 1 in the case when the current node is the right child, which is not needed. Also, the pseudo-code omits the initialization of the index as the size of the left subtree of v, and it should stop when current is the root (not when current is not the root). |
| d2f991_sol015 | 1 | The response suggests using a hash map for pipes and a balanced binary search tree for hole distances, which aligns with the ground truth's mention of a hash table mapping pipes to AVL trees. However, the response misses the critical aspect of using a min-heap to efficiently track and prioritize the closest pairs of holes across all pipes. The explanation for the 'Patch a Hole' operation is also inefficient (O(k log k)), as it suggests checking all pipes, whereas the min-heap in the ground truth allows for O(log k) patching. |
| d2f991_sol016 | 0 | The response suggests using a balanced interval tree, fenwick tree, and hash map, which is significantly different from the ground truth's AVL tree augmented with specific subtree properties. The proposed solution does not align with the ground truth's approach of maintaining an AVL tree with augmented data for efficient computation of active ranges. |
| e882fl_sol000 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a justification that aligns with the ground truth: it explains that 2^(2η) grows much faster than 2^η and cannot be bounded by constant multiples of it. |
| e882fl_sol001 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the answer as false and provides a reasonable justification based on the Master Theorem. However, it incorrectly assumes the recurrence relation is T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n^2 instead of T(n) = 2T(n) + n^2 (which is mathematically not useful). The provided solution is close to the ground truth, so a partially correct score is suitable. |
| e882fl_sol002 | 2 | The LLM correctly answered 'True' and provided a correct justification relating to the definition of amortized analysis. It basically restates the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol003 | 2 | The LLM correctly identified the answer as false and provided a good explanation that while each merge process compares an item with O(log n) items, there are multiple merge steps, leading to comparisons exceeding O(log n) overall, it is similar to the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol004 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and gives a correct explanation that constructing an AVL tree generally takes O(n log n) comparisons because of the balancing operations. This aligns with the ground truth's reasoning, although it phrases it slightly differently. |
| e882fl_sol005 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a reasonable justification. It acknowledges that a vertex can be processed before reaching another through a different path in an acyclic graph, which matches the core idea of the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol006 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly claims that the witness must be on the negative weight cycle, when the ground truth states it is only guaranteed to be reachable from it. The LLM also answers True, which is incorrect. |
| e882fl_sol007 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that both Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's algorithm have the same asymptotic running time of O(n^3) for weighted complete graphs and provides a valid justification. |
| e882fl_sol008 | 2 | The answer is fully correct, the justification aligns with the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol009 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the answer as false. However, the justification is a bit convoluted and doesn't directly state that a polynomial-time algorithm is also a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm. It's partially correct because it understands the concept but doesn't provide the most direct and concise explanation. |
| e882fl_sol010 | 1 | The response uses Kruskal's algorithm to find a MST, which is related to the problem but not the most direct approach. The ground truth suggests binary search and reachability checks, which is a more efficient and targeted method. While the LLM's approach could work, it's less aligned with the optimal solution described in the ground truth and might not guarantee O(|E|log|E|) in all cases, thus only partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol011 | 1 | The LLM response provides a high-level approach based on Dijkstra's algorithm with state augmentation, but it's not entirely correct in the context of the problem's efficiency requirements and constraints. The response lacks the specific graph construction and DAG relaxation steps outlined in the ground truth, which are crucial for achieving the O(nd) time complexity. While Dijkstra's algorithm can be adapted, the explanation doesn't clarify how it can guarantee visiting each city-day combination only once, which is necessary for the required time complexity. Thus, the response is partially correct, as it presents a valid approach but misses key optimizations and details. |
| e882fl_sol012 | 1 | The LLM response suggests an algorithm that correctly decomposes the problem into shortest path calculations within the red, green, and blue components, but the proposed solution is too vague and mixes several algorithms that would not be appropriate (e.g., Dijkstra with uniform weights is BFS). The LLM response does not explicitly construct the intermediate graphs G', G'' and G''' as described in the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol013 | 1 | The response uses dynamic programming, which aligns with the ground truth's approach. It correctly identifies the need for a DP table dp[i][j] to store the number of (m, k)-separated subsets. However, the description of the dynamic programming transition and the method to enforce the |a - b| >= k separation condition is vague and lacks the detail and correctness of the ground truth. Specifically, it doesn't define the f(i) function or clearly explain how to avoid including elements smaller than A[i] + k when A[i] is used. The time complexity analysis mentions an O(n^2 * m) complexity, which is consistent with the target complexity but the reasoning lacks details. |
| e882fl_sol014 | 0 | The LLM provides a DP solution, but the DP definition is flawed. It attempts to sort guests by favor in decreasing order which violates the monotonic increase in favor towards the queen. The state transition equations are also incorrect as they rely on a vague 'g_prev' and don't account for the problem constraints. The time complexity analysis is also misleading, as the proposed algorithm would not achieve O(n^3) due to the incorrect state transitions and sorting. |
| e882fl_sol015 | 1 | The LLM response presents an algorithm that aims to find a Pythagorean Quad in O(n^2) time, but the complexity analysis is incorrect, yielding O(n^3). Additionally, the LLM response misses the crucial optimization from the ground truth. The ground truth uses the equation  a² + b² = d² – c² to reduce the number of loops required in the algorithm, and hence the overall runtime. |
| e882fl_sol016 | 1 | The response proposes a solution that uses a doubly linked list for managing the order of sightings and hash tables for counts and tracking common species. It fails to use an AVL tree to maintain the counts of sightings per zone, and does not augment the tree to maintain the maximum number of sightings for any zone in the subtree. Also, time complexities are not all correct. |
| e882fl_sol017 | 1 | The response gives a correct general idea of the algorithm, but contains an error in Step 2 by suggesting the use of counting sort or radix sort without verifying that the assumptions these algorithms rely on actually hold, such as knowing the range of the values to be sorted, or claiming that sorting E takes O(k) time, which is incorrect. |
| e882fl_sol018 | 1 | The response uses Radix sort which is correct, but misses important aspects from the ground truth answer (splitting into two arrays and sorting them differently). Also, the base for radix sort isn't correctly identified which affects the overall time complexity. |
| f1c1b2_sol000 | 2 | The response is fully correct. It correctly identifies the problem, states the DFS/BFS approach and provides a proper algorithm. It also mentions the proper time and space complexity of O(nm). |
| f1c1b2_sol001 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the graph as unicyclic and proposes an approach leveraging this structure. However, the proposed solution lacks the detailed steps and specific reasoning for achieving O(|V|) time complexity, especially in cycle detection and path weight calculation. It does not include key steps from the ground truth such as removing cycle edges. Therefore, it is partially correct. |
| f1c1b2_sol002 | 2 | The response accurately describes the algorithm for finding the shortest path while avoiding doughnut shops. It correctly identifies the need to create exclusion zones, prune the graph, and apply Dijkstra's algorithm. The time complexity is also correctly stated as O(n log n). |
| f1c1b2_sol003 | 1 | The LLM response provides a dynamic programming solution, which is a valid approach. However, it does not explicitly address how to handle the "at least |V| edges" constraint within the O(|V|^3) time complexity. The ground truth constructs auxiliary graphs to enforce the edge count constraint, while the LLM's approach does not clarify how to efficiently minimize dp[t][k] for k >= |V| within the specified time limit. The initialization and transition steps are correct but incomplete regarding the core constraint, making it partially correct. |
| f2e771_sol000 | 1 | The response correctly proposes a hash table and doubly linked list, and it correctly describes how these data structures support the described operations. However, the response does not address the expected/amortized/worst-case time complexities of each operation. Additionally, the response incorrectly states that the hash table offers worst-case O(1) lookups and insertions, which is only true for average-case/expected time complexity. |
| f2e771_sol001 | 1 | The response correctly suggests using a tree-based approach (BST/AVL) and acknowledges the need for a secondary structure for time-based queries within each latitude. However, it lacks the crucial detail of augmenting the tree with maximum rainfall values in each subtree to achieve O(log n) peak rainfall queries. The description of the peak rainfall query is vague and doesn't fully capture the efficient one-sided range query described in the ground truth. So it is partially correct. |
| mit6_3_sol000 | 0 | The response does not provide the answer to the problem. It only provides a general explanation of polynomial and pseudopolynomial time complexities. |
| mit6_3_sol001 | 0 | The response does not answer the question asked. It provides a general definition of polynomial and pseudopolynomial time but does not indicate whether problem 4 is polynomial or pseudopolynomial. The ground truth clearly states that it is pseudopolynomial. |
| mit6_3_sol002 | 0 | The response does not answer the question and is not specific to problem 5. It provides a general explanation of polynomial vs pseudopolynomial time but fails to choose either option for Problem 5 as requested by the problem description. |
| mit6_3_sol003 | 1 | The LLM response only discusses the high-level approach. It does not fully describe the dynamic programming approach required for the problem. It also includes a sorting step that is not present in the ground truth. The algorithm description does not fully conform to the ground truth. |
| mit6_3_sol004 | 1 | The answer contains the correct overall idea of using dynamic programming with a table of size O(nm), but the subproblem definitions and recurrence relation are not correct. It incorrectly assumes A and B have the same elements. The ground truth uses two tables, one for A and one for B, and combines them at the end. |
| mit6_3_sol005 | 0 | The response uses flow network to determine whether it is possible to assign the students equally to the three breakout rooms. The ground truth uses Dynamic Programming. The time complexity of LLM response is incorrect. The ground truth and LLM response have no overlaps in the method to solve this question. |
