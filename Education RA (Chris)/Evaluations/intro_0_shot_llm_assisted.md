| 156473_sol000 | 1 | The response provides a dynamic programming algorithm, which is correct. However, the recurrence is not correct. The recurrence dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + w_i, dp[i-3] + w_i, ..., dp[i-7] + w_i) does not capture the constraint that you can only play twice in any seven day period. For example, if Tiffany plays on day i-1, then she cannot play on days {i-6, ..., i}. This constraint is not handled in the proposed response. |
| 156473_sol001 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the problem and proposes a dynamic programming approach to solve it. It breaks down the problem into steps and discusses the time complexity. However, the dynamic programming formulation and the recurrence relation aren't as precisely defined as in the ground truth. Additionally, the ground truth leverages a different DP state definition that is more efficient in terms of computation and leads to a more concise algorithm description. Specifically, the LLM's recurrence relation described in step 5 is not correct, contributing to a time complexity of O(n^3) for the subsequence check rather than the implied O(n^2) based on the DP table definition, which inflates the final complexity, although the conclusion states the O(n^4) complexity correctly. |
| 156473_sol002 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies the problem as a variant of the knapsack problem with additional constraints. It also correctly defines the DP table dimensions (i, j, m) and provides the correct recurrence relation and base case logic. However, the initialization step isn't sufficiently precise. It should initialize dp[0][0][0] = 0 and all other entries to -infinity. It also does not properly state the return condition (it should be dp[n][k][s]), which makes the answer only partially correct. |
| 156473_sol003 | 1 | The solution provides a dynamic programming approach. The subproblem definition is not as precise as the ground truth, and the recursive relation provided is slightly off as well. It is trying to minimize the cost to obtain the first i monsters, instead of the cost of catching monsters m_i to m_n starting from location j. |
| 20ec72_sol000 | 1 | The response is partially correct. It uses dynamic programming to attempt to solve the problem, which is a valid approach. However, the DP formulation is not entirely correct, it calculates the minimum weight path from v to every other node with i edges, and thus needs to consider cycles from all nodes back to v to detect the minimum weight cycle containing v with exactly k edges. This complicates cycle detection. Also, it does not mention graph preprocessing to ensure reachability from v, which is a minor issue. Overall, the approach is reasonable, but the details are flawed and require significant modifications to align with the ground truth. |
| 20ec72_sol001 | 1 | The response presents a modified Dijkstra's algorithm, but it doesn't construct a new graph to represent the color changes as edges, which is the core idea of the ground truth solution. The response correctly identifies the need to track the cost to reach a vertex with a specific color and the penalty for changing colors, but the implementation is not as efficient as the ground truth's graph transformation approach. The response correctly identifies the need to account for color changes and uses a priority queue, but does not precompute the graph. |
| 20ec72_sol002 | 1 | The response suggests using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is not O(k) time. The ground truth relies on constructing an unweighted graph and performing BFS in O(k) time. |
| 20ec72_sol003 | 1 | The response provides an approach using Floyd-Warshall which can detect the presence of negative cycles, but it doesn't fully address the cycle-sparse property to efficiently count the number of negative-weight cycles as the ground truth does. The key idea from the ground truth, which involves creating a supernode and using Bellman-Ford to identify vertices reachable from negative cycles and then counting connected components, is missing. |
| 20ec72_sol004 | 1 | The LLM response is partially correct. It correctly recognizes that a modified Dijkstra's algorithm can be used. However, the ground truth solution performs a reweighting that ensures edge weights are non-negative, which allows Dijkstra to be applied and ensures the O(nlogn) time complexity. Without the reweighting step, the LLM's solution may not always yield the correct result as Dijkstra's is not guaranteed to work with negative edge weights. Furthermore, the ground truth answer explains more meticulously why such an algorithm works. For example, by showing that Bellham will neither exceed or exhaust her tank by driving on a simple path from s to t. |
| d2f991_sol000 | 0 | The response incorrectly analyzes the worst-case run time. The prompt specifies that the Python list is implemented using a dynamic array, meaning that appending to the list can be O(n) in the worst case. Therefore, the worst-case run time is O(n^2) instead of O(n+k) |
| d2f991_sol001 | 1 | The LLM gets the correct answer for the dictionary implementation, but not the list implementation. Also, since the user didn't provide the code for the functions, the LLM's reasoning is based on assumptions about how the code works. The question asks for the expected running time, which should just be O(n). The LLM response gives an explanation as well. |
| d2f991_sol002 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the worst-case running time for the array-based approach as O(n + k). However, it incorrectly states the worst-case running time for the dictionary-based approach as O(n). In the worst case, traversing the dictionary entries to find the maximum frequency key requires O(n) (number of elements inserted which is n). So the overall complexity remains O(n). |
| d2f991_sol003 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the O(n+k) running time but also includes the O(n) case that is not correct. |
| d2f991_sol004 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies that the smallest integer would be at the root (A). The explanation is also accurate. |
| d2f991_sol005 | 0 | The response only included C as a possible answer. The ground truth included B, C, D, E, F, and G. The response is missing several elements in the correct answer. |
| d2f991_sol006 | 2 | The response correctly identifies that the items F, G, H, I, and J could have the key with the largest integer. The explanation provided is also correct and clearly explains why these items are the possible locations for the largest key in the min-heap. |
| d2f991_sol007 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct array representations before and after the delete_max operation. It explains the process but doesn't give the specific arrays as requested in the ground truth. |
| d2f991_sol008 | 0 | The LLM completely fails to answer the question about delete_at(3) of Sequence AVL tree. The Sequence AVL tree in the problem is (17,63,11,13) which can be split as  (17, (63,11,13)). delete_at(1) on (63,11,13) will lead to the tree (17, (85,11,13)). Then delete_at(3) on this tree will lead to (17, (85, 11)), which can be further merged as (17, 85, 11, 13). |
| d2f991_sol009 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies that counting sort is the most efficient algorithm and justifies its reasoning. It also correctly states that the overall sorting operation can be completed in O(n) time. The response mirrors the ground truth. |
| d2f991_sol010 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies a comparison sort and that merge sort will work in O(nlogn) time. It also provides a justification. |
| d2f991_sol011 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies Selection Sort as the most efficient sorting algorithm in this scenario, given the O(1) time complexity for determining the bravest student. The explanation aligns with the ground truth, justifying the choice of Selection Sort due to the specific problem constraints. |
| d2f991_sol012 | 0 | The LLM response suggests Merge Sort which has \( O(n \log n) \) complexity. The ground truth suggest Radix Sort with complexity O(n). |
| d2f991_sol013 | 2 | The LLM response provides a correct O(n^2) algorithm using a hash set (similar to a hash table). It correctly describes the steps, including initializing a hash set, iterating over A and B to compute potential complements, and checking array C against the hash set. The pseudocode is also accurate. The explanation of the time complexity is correct as well. Therefore, it is fully correct. |
| d2f991_sol014 | 2 | The LLM provides a correct algorithm that runs in O(log n) time. The algorithm is clearly explained with all the cases considered. |
| d2f991_sol015 | 0 | The response proposes a database design using tables, which is not aligned with the ground truth's data structures of AVL trees, hash tables, and a min-heap. The operations are described in terms of database queries and table updates, rather than operations on the specified data structures. Therefore, it does not address the question correctly. |
| d2f991_sol016 | 1 | The response suggests using Binary Index Tree, Balanced Binary Search Tree or Segment Tree. All of which are valid approaches. However, it does not provide the augmentation of subtree properties which is a crucial component of the ground truth answer. |
| e882fl_sol000 | 2 | The answer is correct and the justification accurately explains why the functions do not grow at the same rate, referencing the exponential growth of 2^{2η} compared to the linear growth of 2η. |
| e882fl_sol001 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly identifies the recurrence relation and uses a different one to apply the Master Theorem, leading to an incorrect conclusion. The original recurrence provided does not fit the standard form for the Master Theorem, but even correcting it makes the logic wrong. |
| e882fl_sol002 | 2 | The answer is correct and the justification aligns with the ground truth's concept of amortization. |
| e882fl_sol003 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a valid justification based on the merging process in merge sort, aligning with the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol004 | 2 | The answer is correct (False). The justification does not exactly match the ground truth (it argues from the AVL insertion bound), but it does correctly explain why the construction would require O(n log n) comparisons, making the given statement false. Hence, it's a fully correct answer. |
| e882fl_sol005 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a valid justification that aligns with the ground truth, explaining why the condition described doesn't necessarily imply a cycle in a directed graph. |
| e882fl_sol006 | 0 | The answer is incorrect. The justification is a flawed explanation of why the LLM thinks it is true. The justification is not sufficient because it doesn't cover the specific caveat in the ground truth. |
| e882fl_sol007 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the answer as True and provides a sufficient justification. The justification explains the time complexity of both Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's Algorithm on complete graphs, demonstrating an understanding of why they have the same asymptotic running time in this specific scenario. |
| e882fl_sol008 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies that subset sum is a special case of knapsack where values and weights are identical. The justification is also correct. |
| e882fl_sol009 | 2 | The answer is correct and the justification accurately captures the relationship between pseudopolynomial time and polynomial time, and how a problem can have both. |
| e882fl_sol010 | 1 | The response proposes a solution based on Kruskal's algorithm and DSU to find the critical edge that maintains connectivity. While the approach has some merit, it deviates significantly from the ground truth's binary search approach and may not always correctly identify the largest k such that Gk is not connected. The core idea of using a sorted edge list is correct, but the overall logic and result calculation are flawed. It also does not explain why it meets the O(|E|log|E|) criteria. |
| e882fl_sol011 | 1 | The response proposes a dynamic programming approach with a recursion formula combined with breadth-first search (BFS). However, the time complexity is O(ndb), which is not O(nd) as requested. The ground truth constructs a graph and runs DAG Relaxation to compute single-source shortest paths. |
| e882fl_sol012 | 1 | The LLM response fails to incorporate the insight that the edges Er, Eg, and Eb can be considered one at a time, leading to an efficient algorithm. |
| e882fl_sol013 | 1 | The response attempts to use dynamic programming but the transition function is incorrect for (m,k)-separated subsets, and does not correctly enforce the separation condition. The time complexity analysis mentions O(n^2m) but it's not clearly derived from the algorithm's steps, and the explanation is vague. It misses the crucial sorting step to efficiently check the separation condition. |
| e882fl_sol014 | 1 | The LLM provides a DP solution, but it has several flaws. It suggests sorting the guests by favor in descending order, but the ground truth specifies sorting in increasing order. The DP state definition dp[left][right] where left + right = n is incorrect, as it does not account for the favor constraint. It also fails to specify the topological order clearly. Thus, the LLM response is only partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol015 | 1 | The response uses a similar precomputation approach to the ground truth, but the execution is different. The generated solution attempts to create all possible sums, while the ground truth aims to find matching pairs instead. The running time is correctly identified as O(n^2), but the solution is ultimately not valid. |
| e882fl_sol016 | 1 | The response proposes using a doubly linked list for the sightings log and a nested hash map for tracking sightings per species and zone, along with a set for common species. The initialize, add_sighting, and is_common operations align with the time complexities specified in the problem. However, the remove_oldest operation's complexity isn't fully justified, particularly regarding the recomputation of common status. Also, the use of AVL trees to store the zones for each species is not mentioned, so the O(logn) insertion, deletion, and search times cannot be guaranteed. |
| e882fl_sol017 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the partitioning and merging steps as in the ground truth. However, it proposes using count sort for the even numbers, which would only be O(k) if the range of numbers is small. Given that the problem states that the array contains n distinct integers, this would not be the case, and count sort would likely be O(n), making the sorting step take O(n) rather than O(k log k). Therefore, the overall time complexity is not O(n) and the answer is partially correct. |
| e882fl_sol018 | 1 | The answer suggests using counting sort, which is a good direction, but the explanation on how to apply it to achieve O(n) complexity is vague and lacks the necessary details, especially regarding the constraint of x_i, y_i < n^2. Does not describe separating into two arrays. |
| f1c1b2_sol000 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies and implements a DFS algorithm to count the number of blobs in the image in O(nm) time. The response also correctly states the space complexity. |
| f1c1b2_sol001 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the graph as unicyclic and proposes a DFS-based approach to find the cycle. It also suggests evaluating paths involving the cycle. However, it lacks the crucial detail of breaking the cycle to create a tree and then using tree path algorithms. The explanation of how to evaluate paths and handle cases where s and t are/aren't on the cycle is vague and doesn't fully align with the ground truth's approach of considering two trees formed by removing cycle edges. |
| f1c1b2_sol002 | 1 | The response provides a correct high-level approach using Dijkstra's algorithm on a modified graph. However, it uses BFS for preprocessing which can be inefficient depending on the distribution of doughnut shops and their proximity. The ground truth uses Dijkstra's for this preprocessing, leading to a more precise and efficient solution. The time complexity analysis in the response is partially flawed. While it correctly states the complexity of Dijkstra and simplifies it given the constraint on node degrees, the complexity for preprocessing is inaccurate due to the breadth-first search (BFS), and is thus only partially correct. |
| f1c1b2_sol003 | 1 | The LLM response provides a dynamic programming solution that correctly formulates the problem and aims to find the minimum weight path from s to t using at least |V| edges. It initializes a dp table to store minimum weights of paths from s to v using exactly k edges, iterates through edges to update dp table, and attempts to find the minimum path weight with at least n edges. However, the algorithm presented has a critical flaw: it only considers paths with *exactly* k edges for k from 1 to |V|, failing to account for paths with *more* than |V| edges, which is a requirement in the problem statement. Also, the LLM assumes min_k >= n dp[t][k] can be done in O(1) time. The Ground Truth produces two intermediate graphs to address the problem. |
| f2e771_sol000 | 2 | The LLM response correctly describes the data structures to use (hash table and doubly-linked list). It also correctly describes the operations with the correct time complexity. |
| f2e771_sol001 | 1 | The response describes a balanced BST, which is a good start. However, it doesn't use a two-level data structure (as in the ground truth), and the description of the peak_rainfall query is vague and does not clearly achieve O(log n) time complexity. |
| mit6_3_sol000 | 0 | The response provides a general description of polynomial vs pseudo-polynomial, but fails to answer the specific question about problem 3 in the original prompt. It states that it cannot answer the question without additional details. Therefore the response is incorrect. |
| mit6_3_sol001 | 0 | The response provides general information about polynomial and pseudopolynomial time but does not answer the question about Problem 4. The response doesn't actually provide the answer, only general background. |
| mit6_3_sol002 | 0 | The response does not directly answer the question, but instead provides a definition of Polynomial and Pseudopolynomial time. The question asks to circle the correct answer for problem 5, but the response does not do this. |
| mit6_3_sol003 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the need for a hash table and dynamic programming. However, it incorrectly defines the subproblem in the dynamic programming portion. The subproblem should be defined as the maximum total value of any gameplay on suffix T[i:], but instead, it is defined as the maximum total value obtainable using subarrays ending at index i. In addition, the LLM response does not specify where parent pointers should be stored, which is crucial to reconstruct the gameplay. |
| mit6_3_sol004 | 1 | The solution uses dynamic programming, which aligns with the general approach in the ground truth. However, the details of the subproblems and recurrence relations are not correctly formulated. The provided dynamic programming approach merges the logic for sets A and B into a single dp array, which doesn't accurately reflect the limited and unlimited constraints for elements from sets A and B, respectively. The response also does not specify the base cases. |
| mit6_3_sol005 | 2 | The LLM response provides a correct and well-structured algorithm that aligns with the ground truth solution. The key components, including subproblem definition, recurrence relation, base case, and time complexity analysis, are accurately described. The algorithm correctly uses dynamic programming to find the maximum benefit assignment while ensuring each student has a positive benefit. It effectively describes the O(n³) time complexity. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the problem and provides a comprehensive solution. |
