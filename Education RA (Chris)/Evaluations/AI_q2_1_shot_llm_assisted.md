## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q2_0 | 1 | The response identifies possible splits and evaluates them, but the chosen split at x=2 is not the optimal one according to the ground truth (f1 > 1.5). The final decision tree is also incorrect based on the ground truth. |
| q2_1 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the two decision boundaries as x1 = 1.5 and x2 = 0.5. The explanation is clear and accurate. |
| q2_2 | 1 | The LLM response provides a reasonable explanation for choosing the top-level test but does not include the explicit average entropy calculation mentioned in the ground truth. It correctly identifies the potential splits along x1 and x2 and provides a rationale for choosing x1 = 1.5. However, it lacks the key quantitative element (AE calculation) making it only partially correct. |
| q2_3 | 2 | The LLM's answer correctly predicts the class for the point (1, -1.01) as Positive, matching the ground truth. It also provides a reasonable explanation based on the decision tree's structure and the majority class rule. |
| q2_4 | 1 | The LLM response describes how to calculate the decision boundary (perpendicular bisector), however the ground truth requests a more general description which the LLM does provide in the first sentence ('bisecting the space between data points of different classes'). |
| q2_5 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct answer. The correct answer should be positive since the closest neighbor is (1,0). However, the response only explains the procedure to find the nearest neighbor without providing the answer. |
| q2_6 | 0 | The LLM does not provide the correct class prediction, and does not list the correct neighbors. The LLM answer is too generic. |
| q2_7 | 1 | The LLM response gives a description of the perceptron algorithm and performs several updates to attempt to converge to the correct separator. However, the updates don't follow the same order and do not converge to the specified separator (0, 1, 2). Therefore, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q2_8 | 2 | The LLM correctly predicts the class and provides a complete and accurate explanation. The calculations and the final classification are correct. |
| q2_9 | 1 | The response identifies that the problem cannot be solved using a perceptron due to the data not being linearly separable. However, it also includes a case where the dataset *is* linearly separable and explains that case. The question asks what happens in the case of the dataset provided, which is not linearly separable, thus it does not fully satisfy the question. |
| q2_10 | 2 | The LLM response correctly computes the sigmoid outputs for each of the given points with the specified weights. The calculations and final answers are accurate and match the ground truth. |
| q2_11 | 1 | The LLM response provides a detailed step-by-step calculation of \(\Delta w_2\) using backpropagation, but it does not arrive at the correct final numerical answer due to not using the correct target value (given as 0 in the original question). The response correctly identifies the formula and process but needs the correct variable substitution to match the ground truth (close but not completely right). |
| q2_12 | 2 | The LLM provides the correct calculations and explanations for all three probabilities, matching the ground truth exactly. |
| q2_13 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies x_3 as the most influential feature and provides a clear explanation based on the class-conditional probabilities. |
| q2_14 | 0 | The LLM response suggests Logistic Regression or SVM, while the ground truth indicates K-Nearest Neighbors. None of the suggested answers match the ground truth. |
| q2_15 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies decision trees as the best algorithm and provides a good justification, mirroring the ground truth. |
| q2_16 | 1 | The LLM suggests SGD which can handle high dimensionality. The ground truth suggests Naive Bayes. Both algorithms can handle high dimensionality, but Naive Bayes is generally considered more suitable for this task, thus the LLM is partially correct. |
| q2_17 | 1 | The LLM response is mostly correct. It identifies Regression and Neural Networks as suitable algorithms, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it overemphasizes Regression models and includes specifics like Linear Regression and SVR, which are not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. The Neural Network suggestion is correct. |
| q2_18 | 1 | The answer mentions perceptron is a linear classifier, which relates to the fixed hypothesis class (linear separators). However, it fails to explicitly mention "Fixed hypothesis class" or "No complexity penalty". |
| q2_19 | 1 | The response includes some correct elements from the ground truth, like maximizing the margin to control complexity. However, it adds extra, unnecessary details about the formulation with constraints, which, while technically correct, aren't essential for addressing the core of the question based on the ground truth provided. |
| q2_20 | 1 | The response contains the relevant information from the ground truth, but adds a lot of irrelevant information that is not explicitly wrong, but is not needed. Partially correct. |
| q2_21 | 1 | The LLM response provides more detail than the ground truth, but the key point of 'no explicit complexity control' is implicitly present in the discussion of overfitting. Thus, it is partially correct. |
| q2_22 | 2 | The response completely and accurately describes the SVM algorithm's complexity penalty and optimization tradeoff as stated in the ground truth, providing a good explanation of the 'c' parameter's role. |
| q2_23 | 1 | The response correctly describes the general behavior of a 2-NN regression, noting the piecewise constant structure and the averaging of the two nearest neighbors. However, it does not explicitly state the jumps occur at the midpoints between data points, which is a key characteristic for the specific question. Therefore, it's partially correct. |
| q2_24 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the stepwise constant nature of regression trees and the correspondence between regions and data partitions. However, it overemphasizes the leaf size being 1, implying each leaf *always* corresponds to one data point which is not entirely accurate in all scenarios, even though it's the intent. The Ground Truth mentions "Stepwise constant regions matching data partitions", which is captured, but the response explanation is slightly misleading. |
| q2_25 | 1 | The response provides a good description of a linear neural network for regression, but it doesn't actually draw the regression output as requested. While the description implies a straight line, it doesn't explicitly state that it is a straight line fit minimizing MSE, which is the ground truth. Therefore, it's partially correct. |
| q2_26 | 1 | The response explains what a multi-layer neural network regression output looks like. The ground truth only asked for a description of the regression output, while the response goes into great detail about how the network can create such a result. This is slightly more than required, but is still relevant to the answer. |
| q2_27 | 1 | The LLM response correctly classifies whether each separator correctly separates positive and negative points. However, the ground truth asks about if the separators satisfy the SVM conditions, which includes whether the margins are maximized or the scaling is correct. The LLM does not evaluate whether the separators maximize the margin. |
| q2_28 | 0 | The LLM response does not provide the correct mapping between kernels and decision boundaries as stated in the ground truth. It only gives a general description of how each kernel works, without actually matching them to the diagrams (which were not provided in the LLM response, but are necessary for a complete answer). |
