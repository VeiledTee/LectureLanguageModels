| 441462sols000 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a reasonable explanation, although it doesn't directly address the core reason (no negation) as the ground truth suggests. It captures the essence of why Strassen's technique is not applicable to Floyd-Warshall. |
| 441462sols001 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that Johnson's algorithm is faster for the given condition and provides the correct time complexities for both algorithms with justification. |
| 441462sols002 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false, but the explanation is not quite as precise as the ground truth (DAG). While it correctly points out that subproblems can have multiple dependencies, it incorrectly claims this causes the graph to have cycles. Cycles are not possible in a Dynamic Programming dependency graph. The ground truth correctly identified the graph as a DAG. |
| 441462sols003 | 0 | The answer is wrong. The provided example seems to be trying to argue about Hamiltonian cycles which are not relevant to the question about MSTs. The lowest weight edge is indeed always part of some MST. |
| 441462sols004 | 0 | The LLM's answer is incorrect, as it states that Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm must be used, and fails to realize that since the graph has n nodes and n edges, it must only contain one cycle. |
| 441462sols005 | 0 | The LLM's answer is wrong. The algorithm runs in O(E|f|) time, not O((V+E)|f|) as suggested by the question, but the question still holds true and thus the answer should have been true. |
| 441462sols006 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a valid explanation with an example. This aligns perfectly with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols007 | 1 | The answer is "False" which is correct. The provided justification is not as precise as the ground truth since the example provided has a unique solution and is not degenerate. Therefore, it is partially correct. |
| 441462sols008 | 2 | The answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth. |
| 441462sols009 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false. However, it does not give the correct approximation factor as log-log. So, it is only partially correct. |
| 441462sols010 | 1 | The LLM identifies a path from Boston to New York but it's not the shortest path in the graph. The shortest path is Boston, A, D, G, New York. |
| 441462sols011 | 1 | The answer incorrectly identifies the shortest path. The path should be 1-2-3-4-5-6 since the problem states that there is a charging station at node 4. The correct path has total length 50+50+200+50+50 = 400. The student's path 1-2-3-5-6 has length 50+50+50+50 = 200. Student gets partial credit because they correctly identify that the car needs to charge at node 3 and the car cannot exceed m miles between charging stations. |
| 441462sols012 | 1 | The LLM provides a reasonable approach, which involves modifying the graph and then running Dijkstra's. However, the response has some incorrect steps. Specifically, it replaces each vertex with a charging station with two vertices. This is not necessary. Also, the runtime analysis is incorrect. Thus, the answer is only partially correct. |
| 441462sols013 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies that sorting is required and provides the correct runtime. However, the given sorting order is incorrect. It provides the argument for why swapping would be better, but mixes up the inequality. Also, the increase in penalty is calculated incorrectly. |
| 441462sols014 | 0 | The response is wrong. The correct answer should be |E| + m - 1 or |V| + m – 2. The response gives m nights which is incorrect. |
| 441462sols015 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the need for a binary search to find the minimum number of nights. However, the time complexity is not accurate, missing the (E+m) factor and having an incorrect log factor. Therefore, it's partially correct. |
| 441462sols016 | 0 | The response suggests solving an LP, which is not the algorithm described in the ground truth (max flow). Furthermore, it lacks the specific construction of the graph G' as outlined in the ground truth. The time complexity analysis is also vague (polynomial) and doesn't match the detailed analysis expected. |
| 441462sols017 | 1 | The LLM response contains the correct general idea of using max flow to solve the problem. It correctly describes the nodes and edges in the network. However, the edge capacities from the source to each day are reversed compared to the ground truth. The response suggests edges from s to each day node with capacity 1, but the ground truth specifies edges from each day node to the sink with capacity 1. |
| 441462sols018 | 2 | The answer is fully correct. It correctly outlines the steps to determine if a directed graph contains either a cycle or a Hamiltonian path. It first checks for a cycle using DFS. If no cycle exists, it performs a topological sort and then checks for a Hamiltonian path by verifying the existence of edges between consecutive vertices in the topological order. |
| 441462sols019 | 0 | The answer does not construct the graph G' as described in the ground truth. It attempts to add two nodes and connect them to the existing graph in a different way, which does not guarantee that the existence of a Hamiltonian path in G implies the existence of both a cycle and a Hamiltonian path in G'. The reasoning about cycles and Hamiltonian paths in G' is also flawed. |
| 5b6cd1sols000 | 0 | The answer is wrong. The ground truth states that the statement is True, while the LLM response says it is False. Also, the explanation provided is incorrect as earliest start time does not guarantee an optimal solution. |
| 5b6cd1sols001 | 1 | The response initially states the incorrect answer, but then provides the correct time complexity and approach. Thus, it is only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols002 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a reason that aligns with the ground truth, though the specific recurrence and its solution are not exactly the same. The ground truth mentions T(n) = T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + O(n), while the LLM response suggests recurse twice on arrays of size n/4 which leads to T(n) = O(n log n). The core idea of needing groups of at least 5 for a linear-time algorithm is implicit in the explanation. |
| 5b6cd1sols003 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the statement as true and provides a flawed justification based on multiplying the merge time by the number of levels, failing to consider the recurrence relation and Master Theorem, which the ground truth highlights. |
| 5b6cd1sols004 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly states that Van Emde Boas sort can be used to sort n = lg u numbers in O(lg u \* lg lg lg u) time. The ground truth says the statement is false and explains why. |
| 5b6cd1sols005 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a reason. However, it only mentions the space complexity issue and doesn't acknowledge the randomization aspect mentioned in the ground truth, which is why it is only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols006 | 0 | The answer is wrong. The potential energy should never go negative. |
| 5b6cd1sols007 | 2 | The LLM correctly identified the statement as false and provided the correct auxiliary space complexity, matching the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols008 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies the O(log n) time complexity with high probability and acknowledges a possible worst-case scenario. However, it incorrectly states that the worst-case time complexity is O(n) and that Ω(2n) is impossible. The correct worst-case time complexity is O(n), but the question states the worst-case could be Ω(2n), which the LLM dismisses. The LLM answer chooses 'False', which is the wrong answer. |
| 5b6cd1sols009 | 0 | The LLM's response is incorrect. It calculates the probability of collision for h2(A) and h2(C) and concludes that the collection is universal, which is flawed. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that A and C collide with a probability of 2/3 in the provided hash function collection, making the collection not universal. |
| 5b6cd1sols010 | 0 | The response identifies an error in the inverse FFT calculation, which is not the core issue. The problem lies in not padding the input vectors with zeros before applying the FFT, as the ground truth indicates. The provided answer is incorrect. |
| 5b6cd1sols011 | 1 | The response suggests a balanced tree with O(log n) operations which is partially correct, because it addresses the problem correctly, but the ground truth uses a VEB tree which is faster. So the time complexity is not optimal. |
| 5b6cd1sols012 | 1 | The response uses array instead of linked list, and its analysis of the time complexity of insert and remove are both incorrect. The amortized analysis is hard to follow and does not explain the potential function used. |
| 5b6cd1sols013 | 1 | The LLM response provides a randomized algorithm for verifying polynomial multiplication in O(n) time. It correctly uses a random value and checks if p(x)q(x) = r(x). However, the range from which x is chosen, i.e., {0, 1, ..., 2n*3n}, and the justification are inaccurate. The correct range should be [1, 4n] as specified in the ground truth, and the Polynomial Identity Lemma needs to be applied more precisely to achieve the desired error probability. Also, the range given does not guarantee an error probability of at least 1/2, which is crucial for the algorithm's correctness. |
| 5b6cd1sols014 | 2 | The LLM response correctly proves that if p(x) * q(x) = r(x), then s(x) = 0, which is essentially Property 1. The explanation is clear and logically sound. |
| 5b6cd1sols015 | 0 | The response does not address property 2 at all. It only argues about the case where the polynomials are equal. It does not prove any bound on the probability of error. |
| 5b6cd1sols016 | 1 | The response misses the repetition part for amplification. The logic of polynomial checking is correct, but it does not achieve the probability of success at least 1-epsilon. Also, the time complexity is not O(n) because M = n/epsilon, so the time complexity is O(n^2/epsilon). |
| 5b6cd1sols017 | 1 | The LLM response is partially correct because it presents a dynamic programming approach. However, the recurrence relation presented is not correct as it does not take into account the current tastiness value at cell (i,j). Additionally, the base cases presented are not appropriate for the problem. The base cases should be for TL0,j and TLi,0, and they should be initialized to 0 or a very small number. |
| 5b6cd1sols018 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the need for four scans corresponding to the four quadrants and the need to iterate through all possible (i,j). However, it lacks the essential detail of computing and storing the maximum values for each quadrant during the scans (e.g., TL, BL, TR, BR) which is crucial for the O(nm) time complexity. It only suggests scanning without specifying the computation of maximums. |
| 5b6cd1sols019 | 2 | The response correctly identifies the O(m+n) runtime and the approach of merging the two arrays. It also correctly identifies that the median will be at the (m+n)/2 index. |
| 5b6cd1sols020 | 2 | The response is fully correct. It finds the medians of both arrays, compares them, and then discards halves of the arrays based on the comparison. It correctly identifies the O(log n) time complexity. |
| 5b6cd1sols021 | 1 | The LLM response has the correct time complexity, but the algorithm described isn't entirely clear and seems to have some issues with correctly splitting the arrays in a way that guarantees finding the median efficiently. It mentions binary search but doesn't detail the exact condition or subarray used for the search. Also, the base case for termination isn't clearly justified or explained. |
| c212dlsols000 | 1 | The LLM answer correctly identifies the condition under which the statement is true, but it doesn't state that the original statement is false without the independence condition. The ground truth explicitly states 'False' unless independent. |
| c212dlsols001 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the answer as true. The correct answer is false and the provided explanation is flawed as the runtime would be \Theta(n^2), not O(n^2 log n). |
| c212dlsols002 | 0 | The correct answer is False, but the LLM's answer is True. The LLM is wrong. |
| c212dlsols003 | 0 | The LLM response is incorrect as it states that amortization doesn't help, while the ground truth states it does. Therefore the answer is wrong. |
| c212dlsols004 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly identifies the hash family as not universal and provides a clear explanation, similar to the ground truth, using probabilities and comparing to the universality condition. |
| c212dlsols005 | 1 | The response is partially correct because it correctly identifies that the statement is false, but the reasoning is not fully aligned with the ground truth. The ground truth focuses on the issue of cycles leading to infinitely many paths and thus infinite products, while the response discusses length-(n-1) walks. The response captures a key concept of the algorithm, but the explanation is not as complete or accurate as the ground truth's. |
| c212dlsols006 | 0 | The answer is incorrect. The ground truth says the statement is true, while the LLM states it is false. |
| c212dlsols007 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly claims that the second-lowest weight spanning tree is unique, when the ground truth states it is false. |
| c212dlsols008 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct, providing the correct answer (False) and the correct explanation. |
| c212dlsols009 | 2 | The response accurately assesses the correctness of the statement provided in the problem. |
| c212dlsols010 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a valid explanation, which matches the ground truth reason. |
| c212dlsols011 | 0 | The response is marked as False, which is correct. However, the explanation is incorrect. The LLM response states that Alice can compute g^{abc} mod p, which is incorrect. Alice can compute g^{ab} mod p and g^{ac} mod p, but she cannot directly compute g^{abc} mod p. The same logic applies to Bob and Charlie. Thus, Alice, Bob, and Charlie cannot each compute g^{abc} mod p as a shared secret known only to the three of them. |
| c212dlsols012 | 0 | The LLM provides a counterexample which is incorrect. The external memory algorithm will also take O(log_B N) memory transfers, because it knows B. Thus, the answer is wrong. |
| c212dlsols013 | 1 | The answer is correct but the justification gives merge sort as a counterexample, which is not divide-and-conquer algorithm for a problem that admits a time-optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm (merge sort is time-optimal itself). |
| c212dlsols014 | 1 | The response identifies the need to store the sum and size of subtrees at each node, which is correct. However, it does not fully explain how to use this information to answer the AVERAGE(x) query in O(lg n) time. The description of the algorithm is vague and misses the crucial point of summing the y.sum and y.size of left siblings along the path to the leaf with the smallest key larger than x. |
| c212dlsols015 | 1 | The LLM response incorrectly describes how the sum and count are updated during a split. It should recompute the sum for the split nodes and its parent. Also, it mentions z' and z'' which doesn't fit well with the variable naming in the question. |
| c212dlsols016 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. The final answer and reasoning matches the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols017 | 2 | The LLM response correctly calculates the value of k required to achieve the desired probability of Forrest remembering the event. The steps are logically sound and the final answer matches the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols018 | 1 | The response arrives at the correct conclusion that k = O(log n) reminders are needed. The reasoning is sound and follows a logical progression. However, it employs an approximation (ln(1-x) ~ -x) which, while valid for small x, is not rigorously justified in the context of high probability. The conclusion matches the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols019 | 1 | The LLM response provides the correct intuition and conclusion that focusing on the k lowest p_i values and the k highest t_j values is the optimal strategy. However, it lacks the rigorous proof by contradiction and swapping argument present in the ground truth. Thus, it's only partially correct. |
| c212dlsols020 | 1 | The response has some correct ideas (sorting, considering the top k teachers/pieces), but the logic for how to combine teacher time and personal time is flawed. The suggested method of comparing 'total teacher time' to T is not correct, and the notion of incrementally taking time from the most valuable teacher is also not quite aligned with the optimal greedy approach described in the ground truth. It does not have the correct approach for how to combine teachers and individual time. |
| c212dlsols021 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the binary search approach, which is the core idea. However, it incorrectly states the running time as O(m log m * Decision) instead of O(n log n) where 'n' is the number of teachers, and 'm' is the number of pieces. The ground truth considers binary search over the number of pieces he can learn with complexity O(log n). The provided answer mentions Decision algorithm, implying using the black box. Also, the ground truth specifically mentions the time complexity considering the sorting. |
| c212dlsols022 | 2 | The answer is fully correct. It accurately describes the residual graph with correct edge capacities. |
| c212dlsols023 | 0 | The LLM's answer is completely wrong. The shortest augmenting path is not s, v, x, t. It does not follow the ground truth at all. The provided path does not exist in the graph. |
| c212dlsols024 | 0 | The response states the value of the resulting flow is 18 and the ground truth is 26. The response also contains incorrect reasoning. |
| c212dlsols025 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the need to check all subsets of size k. However, it incorrectly estimates the time complexity. Specifically, it says that checking whether any employee is assigned to multiple projects takes O(km) time, where it actually takes O(m) time because one at most needs to check each of the m employees. |
| c212dlsols026 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly claims the algorithm is FPT. The justification is also flawed, as the running time's exponent on n increases with k, violating the FPT requirement of  n^{o(1)} f(k). |
| c212dlsols027 | 1 | The LLM's response has some correct elements, but it deviates significantly from the ground truth reduction. Specifically, the LLM introduces new employees tied to the triples, rather than directly using the elements of X, Y, and Z as employees as the ground truth specifies. This deviation impacts the correctness of the reduction. Thus, it's only partially correct. Also, it introduces $2m^2$ and $m^3$ where they are not required. |
| c212dlsols028 | 1 | The response is mostly correct but mentions sorting the jobs in decreasing order which is not necessary. Also, the runtime is not mentioned. |
| c212dlsols029 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the problem and a greedy algorithm. It also correctly identifies a lower bound. However, the proof is not clear and hard to follow. It has some correct ideas, but it is not well-written or explained, making it only partially correct. |
| c212dlsols030 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct and matches the ground truth in its reasoning and conclusion. It correctly uses the clique property to establish the upper bound of one vertex and the maximality of S to establish the lower bound, thus proving that S contains exactly one vertex of the form (v, i) for each v in V. |
| c212dlsols031 | 0 | The response does not provide a valid solution. The approach of claiming edges is not relevant to the problem of coloring the graph. The response makes claims about UID which are irrelevant to the problem. |
| c212dlsols032 | 1 | The LLM response is partially correct. While it acknowledges the use of Luby's algorithm, its analysis of time and communication complexity isn't entirely correct when compared to the ground truth. The LLM mentions complexities that don't align with the ground truth answer. For instance, it claims $O(1)$ iterations to eliminate the independent set. It also includes an incorrect analysis of the communication complexity by stating that each node must learn its neighbors which require $O(\Delta)$ rounds. This seems to add complexities and procedures that aren't present in the ground truth answer, marking it as only partially correct. |
