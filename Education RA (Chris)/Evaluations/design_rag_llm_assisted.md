|-------------|-------|----------|
| 441462sols000 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false. However, the reasoning doesn't align precisely with the ground truth, which focuses on the lack of a negation operation applicable to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, instead explaining that Strassen's algorithm is specific to matrix multiplication. |
| 441462sols001 | 0 | The answer is false, but the ground truth states that the answer is true. The LLM's reasoning is also flawed, as it incorrectly assumes E = Theta(V^2) when it is given that E = O(V^1.5). |
| 441462sols002 | 0 | The LLM states that the answer is true, which is the opposite of the ground truth. It also does not mention that a dynamic program's dependency graph is a DAG. So, the answer is completely wrong. |
| 441462sols003 | 1 | The answer is true but the explanation is not aligned with the ground truth. It doesn't mention Kruskal's algorithm. |
| 441462sols004 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly claims the statement is false and provides a flawed justification based on the complexity of generic MST algorithms. It fails to recognize the specific structure of the graph (n vertices and n edges implying a single cycle) which allows for an O(n) solution as described in the ground truth. |
| 441462sols005 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as true and provides a valid explanation that aligns with the ground truth, particularly mentioning the integer capacity and the potential for |f| iterations. |
| 441462sols006 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly states the answer is True, while the ground truth is False. The LLM also does not provide the correct justification. There could be another min cut whose capacity does not change, thus the max flow remains the same. |
| 441462sols007 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a similar explanation as the ground truth. The explanation about the objective function being parallel to one of the constraints is consistent with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols008 | 0 | The answer is completely wrong. It starts with True, when the correct answer is False. The justification is also flawed. |
| 441462sols009 | 0 | The LLM answers True, while the correct answer is False. The LLM also incorrectly relates the described algorithm to Approx-Vertex_Cover. |
| 441462sols010 | 0 | The answer fails to provide the correct path as indicated in the ground truth image. The provided path incorrectly lists every node in the graph, whereas the actual shortest path skips some nodes to reduce distance. |
| 441462sols011 | 0 | The LLM fails to provide an answer, stating that it needs a visual representation of the graph and the value of m, even though both are provided in the prompt. Therefore, the response is wrong. |
| 441462sols012 | 1 | The response attempts to use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm, but the modifications are incorrect and would not correctly solve the problem. The ground truth uses Johnson's algorithm followed by Dijkstra on a modified graph. The LLM response is only partially correct as it mentions Dijkstra's but applies it incorrectly. |
| 441462sols013 | 1 | The greedy algorithm described is the inverse of the solution, it should be sorted by increasing di/ci. The running time is correct, and the attempted proof is valid but based on the wrong sort. |
| 441462sols014 | 0 | The response is completely wrong. The number of nights required is not |E|. |
| 441462sols015 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct algorithm which involves using binary search to find the minimum number of nights. Instead, it suggests a modified Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which is not the approach outlined in the ground truth. Also, it fails to relate the time complexity to T(V, E, m) mentioned in the problem. |
| 441462sols016 | 1 | The LLM response describes the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. However, the response does not fully implement the algorithm within the context of the problem (constructing the proper graph as described in the ground truth). Also, the runtime analysis is incorrect for the constructed graph. It only analyzes the basic Ford-Fulkerson runtime. |
| 441462sols017 | 1 | The response creates a graph and uses max flow, similar to the ground truth. However, the graph construction is slightly different (connecting days to people who want to carpool rather than people to days) and the explanation of extracting the driver assignment is vague (mentioning min-cut instead of checking flow on edges). The time complexity is also incorrect. |
| 441462sols018 | 0 | The response suggests using Dijkstra's algorithm to find cycles and Hamiltonian paths, which is incorrect and inefficient. Dijkstra's algorithm is for finding shortest paths in graphs with non-negative edge weights, not for detecting cycles or Hamiltonian paths. The logic for identifying cycles and Hamiltonian paths based on Dijkstra's output is also flawed. The algorithm is not polynomial time. The answer does not align with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols019 | 1 | The reduction proposed by the LLM is not correct. The main idea of the GT answer is present, i.e. construct a cycle and add a path such that the Hamiltonian path can be extended using that cycle. However, the new graph G' constructed is not correct. It should be a cycle of 3 nodes, and then there should be paths from one of the node in the cycle to every other node in G. |
| 5b6cd1sols000 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as true and provides a correct explanation. The mathematical representation is a bit confusing and doesn't add much to the explanation, but it doesn't detract from the correctness. |
| 5b6cd1sols001 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly claims the statement is false and provides an incorrect explanation of why it thinks so. The greedy algorithm does not solve weighted interval scheduling. Dynamic programming can solve weighted interval scheduling in O(n log n) time. |
| 5b6cd1sols002 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false. However, the reasoning is vague and doesn't accurately explain why the described approach fails to achieve linear time. It also brings in other irrelevant aspects, like columns of 5. It would be a better answer if it mentioned the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + O(n) and the fact that it does not solve to T(n) = O(n). |
| 5b6cd1sols003 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly claims the statement is True. Also, the explanation contradicts the ground truth which correctly states that the complexity would be O(n^2) not O(n^2 log n). |
| 5b6cd1sols004 | 0 | The LLM marked the statement as true, while it is actually false. The LLM's justification is also incorrect as Van Emde Boas sort takes n lg lg(u) time which is lg(u) * lg lg(u) if n = lg(u). |
| 5b6cd1sols005 | 0 | The answer is incorrect. The provided explanation is also incorrect. Van Emde Boas on n integers between 0 and u 1 supports successor queries in O(lg lg u) worst-case time using O(u) space, not O(n) space. |
| 5b6cd1sols006 | 2 | The response is fully correct and provides a comprehensive explanation as to why potential energy should never be negative in amortized analysis, aligning with the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols007 | 0 | The response is incorrect. The provided reason is wrong. Quicksort does not necessarily sort in place like insertion sort. Also, the complexity is not O(n) as in the provided answer. |
| 5b6cd1sols008 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly identifies the statement as false. The ground truth states the statement is true, because while the search time is O(log n) with high probability, there is a non-zero probability that the skip list's height could lead to a search time of Î©(2n). |
| 5b6cd1sols009 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the reason for why H is not universal. The ground truth specifies the collision between A and C is the reason, while the response claims it is due to the collision between A and B. |
| 5b6cd1sols010 | 0 | The answer claims that Ben's mistake is with the complex conjugate in the inverse FFT, which is not the problem. The core issue is not padding the input vectors with sufficient zeros to avoid aliasing in the multiplication. |
| 5b6cd1sols011 | 0 | The answer suggests using a balanced BST with O(log n) for each operation. The ground truth suggests using a VEB tree with O(log log n) for each operation. Therefore, the answer is wrong. |
| 5b6cd1sols012 | 0 | The response suggests using a balanced BST, which leads to O(log n) time complexity for insertion. This does not meet the requirement of O(1) amortized time. Also, the LLM response only provides a vague idea of using charging method, without a concrete potential function. Therefore, it is considered wrong. |
| 5b6cd1sols013 | 0 | The response does not provide an O(n) algorithm, but instead provides an O(n log n) algorithm using FFT. The response also does not provide any justification for why the algorithm will output NO with probability at least 1/2. |
| 5b6cd1sols014 | 2 | The LLM accurately states the property and explains why the algorithm satisfies it. |
| 5b6cd1sols015 | 0 | The response does not provide any relevant information or proof related to Property 2. Instead, it discusses the algorithm's complexity and attempts to relate it to the probability of outputting 'YES', which is not aligned with the ground truth's focus on bounding the probability of error when s(x) is not identically zero. The mention of FFT is also misleading in the context of the randomized O(n) algorithm intended by the question. |
| 5b6cd1sols016 | 0 | The response suggests using FFT which the prompt discourages. Furthermore, the probability analysis is wrong, and there is no repetition to amplify the probability. |
| 5b6cd1sols017 | 2 | The response provides a dynamic programming algorithm to compute TLi,j for all 1 < i < n and 1 < j < m in O(nm) time. The algorithm correctly identifies the recursive relation TLi,j = max{Tij, TLi-1,j, TLi,j-1} and the time complexity. |
| 5b6cd1sols018 | 0 | The response does not use the idea from part a (range maximum) and the response does not provide the correct recurrence relation for the range maximum. |
| 5b6cd1sols019 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct because it correctly provides the naÃ¯ve algorithm that merges the two arrays in O(m+n) and then identifies the median. The explanation is clear and accurate. |
| 5b6cd1sols020 | 2 | The LLM response provides a correct high-level description of the algorithm, including identifying the key steps of comparing medians and reducing the subarrays. The time complexity is also correctly identified. The algorithm presented aligns with the ground truth. The presentation of the steps is coherent. |
| 5b6cd1sols021 | 1 | The response presents a divide and conquer algorithm, but incorrectly claims that discarding halves of the arrays will lead to the correct median. The logic for determining which halves to discard is flawed. The time complexity claim is correct given the proposed algorithm, but the algorithm itself is incorrect. |
| c212dlsols000 | 1 | The answer is partially correct because it states that the probability of A succeeding is equal to the product of p1 and p2, which is true only if the events are independent. However, the problem does not state that the two steps are independent. Therefore, the answer is not fully correct. |
| c212dlsols001 | 0 | The response incorrectly claims the algorithm has time complexity O(n log n). It also fails to analyze the recurrence correctly, claiming the overall time complexity would be O(n^2 log n), instead of O(n^2). |
| c212dlsols002 | 0 | The response is incorrect. The condition is not necessary, any constant fraction works. |
| c212dlsols003 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the correct answer as false. It also incorrectly claims that DELETE-MIN has a cost of O(log n) amortized time. |
| c212dlsols004 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the answer as False and provides a valid justification based on the definition of universal hashing. The explanation is clear and demonstrates understanding of the concept, aligning well with the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols005 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the statement as false, but the justification is not aligned with the ground truth. The response focuses on negation and time complexity, while the ground truth focuses on cycles and infinite paths. |
| c212dlsols006 | 0 | The answer is wrong. The LLM gives the wrong answer, and also the wrong reasoning. |
| c212dlsols007 | 0 | The response is wrong, and provides a flawed justification attempting to prove the opposite of the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols008 | 0 | The LLM's response is incorrect and provides a wrong explanation. It hallucinates the definition of the recurrence relation for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. |
| c212dlsols009 | 0 | The response is wrong. The ground truth says that the statement is true, but the LLM says it is false and provides a wrong justification. |
| c212dlsols010 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the statement as true, while the ground truth says that it is false. The response does not acknowledge the fact that the adversary can replace both the file and the hash with a different file and the hash of that file. |
| c212dlsols011 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the statement as false. However, the reasoning invokes the hardness of the Diffie-Hellman problem, which is not directly relevant to why the shared secret cannot be computed. The ground truth answer provides a more direct explanation, focusing on what each party can and cannot compute with the information available to them. Because the response's reasoning is not as precise as the ground truth, I'm marking it as partially correct. |
| c212dlsols012 | 0 | The answer is wrong. The explanation is internally contradictory, claiming that the external-memory algorithm will have at least the same number of memory transfers as the best cache-oblivious algorithm, and in some cases may have fewer. |
| c212dlsols013 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false. However, the explanation is not directly related to the counterexample (binary search) provided in the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols014 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the need to store the sum of salaries at each node. However, the proposed algorithm for answering the AVERAGE(x) query is incorrect and does not achieve the O(log n) time complexity. It also neglects to include storing the size of the subtree at each node. |
| c212dlsols015 | 0 | The LLM's response misses the key idea that we should store the number of elements and sum of salaries in each subtree. Instead, it describes that each node in the tree stores "the total number of employees in its subtree whose salary is at most x", which doesn't make sense because x is an argument to the AVERAGE(x) function and not a property of the tree. |
| c212dlsols016 | 1 | The LLM response acknowledges the linearity of expectation but fails to consider the number of reminders sent for each event. So the probability is wrong. |
| c212dlsols017 | 0 | The answer uses incorrect reasoning and deviates significantly from the ground truth's approach, misinterpreting probability concepts and failing to derive the correct relationship between k and n. |
| c212dlsols018 | 1 | The response correctly identifies that k = O(log n), but the reasoning is slightly off. It states that "the probability that Forrest remembers an event after receiving k reminders is (1/2)^k", which is incorrect; the probability that Forrest *forgets* is (1/2)^k. Additionally, while the math arrives at the correct big-O, the intermediate steps are flawed. |
| c212dlsols019 | 1 | The LLM response suggests a greedy approach of assigning the k lowest p_i to Prof. Chopin, and then assigning the remaining to the k highest t_j. This is not necessarily optimal. The ground truth answer suggests a proof by contradiction and swapping, which is more correct. |
| c212dlsols020 | 1 | The response does not use the optimal greedy strategy as described in the ground truth. The response sorts the pieces, which is good. But then in 3a it checks p_i <= T, which does not make sense because it should be considering teachers at the same time. The described greedy algorithm in the ground truth ensures that we maximize the number of pieces learned, while the given algorithm is not optimal. |
| c212dlsols021 | 0 | The response does not address the prompt, and it does not use part (b) as a black box. It proposes using Dynamic programming which is irrelevant given the prompt, and its definition of the DP array is not correct. |
| c212dlsols022 | 0 | The LLM response does not provide a residual graph, it only draws the original graph with zero weights in the backward edges. This is completely wrong. |
| c212dlsols023 | 0 | The answer is completely wrong. It fails to find any valid augmenting path, let alone the shortest. The proposed path 's to t' is not a valid path in the graph. |
| c212dlsols024 | 0 | The LLM states that it cannot provide an answer, indicating a failure to address the question. Therefore, the response is wrong. |
| c212dlsols025 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the need to iterate through subsets of k projects but incorrectly states the time complexity. It gives O(mn^k) instead of O(m * (n choose k)), which is a significant difference as (n choose k) is not generally bounded by n^k. The response also doesn't mark employees and check for duplicates. So it is partially correct. |
| c212dlsols026 | 0 | The response incorrectly claims the algorithm is FPT. The ground truth correctly states it is not FPT because the exponent of n depends on k. |
| c212dlsols027 | 2 | The LLM response correctly describes the reduction from 3D matching. The response correctly creates the project set P as the set of triples T, the employee set E as the union of X, Y, and Z, and sets the required employees for each project (triple) to the elements of the triple. It correctly reasons about the equivalence of solutions and provides all details in a clear and concise manner. |
| c212dlsols028 | 1 | The response describes a greedy algorithm, but it only considers the case where there are two machines. Also, the description is not very clear and does not provide a clear definition for w(A) and w(B). |
| c212dlsols029 | 0 | The response does not mention the greedy algorithm, nor does it refer to assigning the last job to the machine that runs for the longest. It makes claims that are not based on the ground truth and is essentially incorrect. |
| c212dlsols030 | 1 | The answer proves only that the independent set can contain at most one vertex of the form (v,i) but does not show that it contains at least one vertex of this form. Therefore, it is only partially correct. |
| c212dlsols031 | 0 | The LLM proposes a simple iterative coloring algorithm that does not work. The ground truth answer proposes simulating an MIS algorithm on the cartesian product of G with a clique of size Delta + 1. |
| c212dlsols032 | 0 | The response does not mention that the cost is only that of solving MIS on G' with time complexity O(log (n*delta)). It also hallucinates that theorem 2 states that the algorithm takes only 1 round and uses n^2 point-to-point messages, which is completely irrelevant to the question. |
