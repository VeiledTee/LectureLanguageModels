| 441462sols000 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a clear and accurate explanation of why Strassen's algorithm cannot be applied to improve the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's running time. The reasoning focuses on the fundamental differences in their algorithmic approaches, specifically the iterative dynamic programming nature of Floyd-Warshall versus the recursive divide-and-conquer strategy of Strassen's algorithm. This is in line with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols001 | 2 | The LLM's response correctly identifies the statement as true and provides a valid justification for why Johnson's algorithm is faster than Floyd-Warshall in this specific case. |
| 441462sols002 | 2 | The answer is fully correct because it correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a clear and accurate explanation of why the graph is a DAG instead of a directed rooted tree. It highlights the key difference that subproblems in dynamic programming can depend on multiple other subproblems, which is not possible in a rooted tree. |
| 441462sols003 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It accurately states the statement is true and provides a correct justification based on the cut property, which aligns with the ground truth, and it also provides an example of how Kruskal's algorithm could use this. |
| 441462sols004 | 0 | The explanation is incorrect because a graph with n vertices and n edges has exactly one cycle, not no cycle. The statement in the LLM response "A connected, weighted graph with \( n \) vertices and exactly \( n \) edges forms a tree" is false. A tree has n-1 edges, not n edges. The ground truth correctly identifies that the graph has one cycle and that the heaviest edge in the cycle should be removed. |
| 441462sols005 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as true and provides a correct justification that aligns with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols006 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct and matches the ground truth by stating that other min cuts could exist and limit the max flow. |
| 441462sols007 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a good explanation with an example. |
| 441462sols008 | 2 | The LLM's response accurately reflects the ground truth, stating that if P=NP, then 3SAT can be solved in polynomial time. |
| 441462sols009 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and explains why the described method is not a 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover. While it doesn't mention the log-log approximation, it accurately points out the standard 2-approximation algorithm and contrasts it with the given method. |
| 441462sols010 | 0 | The LLM response does not provide the correct shortest path from Boston to New York on the graph provided in the PDF. Instead, it gives a generic explanation of how to find the shortest path. Therefore, it is completely wrong. |
| 441462sols011 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct path, or any path at all. It only explains how to find a shortest path. It doesn't even specify nodes in the graph. |
| 441462sols012 | 1 | The response presents a modified Dijkstra's algorithm. While it attempts to incorporate the charging constraint, it fundamentally misunderstands the problem and introduces an incorrect update condition `dist[u] + w(e) <= m`.  The complexity analysis is also incorrect; it states O(VE + V^2 log V) but the described algorithm is more like O(E log V) without the initial precomputation. The key difference between the model's response and ground truth is that the ground truth performs an all-pairs shortest path first. The model's response attempts to solve the problem with a single modified Djikstra's run which is not correct. |
| 441462sols013 | 1 | The answer is mostly correct, but the sorting order is incorrect. The ground truth says to sort by increasing d_i/c_i, while the response says to sort by decreasing c_i/d_i. The proof of correctness is also not mathematically rigorous. |
| 441462sols014 | 2 | The LLM's response provides a correct explanation and arrives at the correct solution: |E| + m - 1. |
| 441462sols015 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies binary search as the required algorithm and provides the correct time complexity. The explanation of the algorithm is also correct. Hence, the solution is fully correct. |
| 441462sols016 | 1 | The LLM's response partially describes the correct approach. It does not correctly model the problem as a series of time steps, and therefore the graph construction and time complexity are incorrect. However, it does correctly identify that this problem can be solved using max flow. |
| 441462sols017 | 2 | The response correctly models the problem as a max flow problem with a bipartite graph. It correctly defines the vertices and edges of the graph along with their capacities. The response also correctly checks if the max flow equals m (number of days) to determine if a valid assignment exists. Therefore, the response is fully correct. |
| 441462sols018 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the polynomial time solution for cycle detection using DFS. However, it states that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian path, which is true in general, but misses the crucial point that after cycle detection, the graph is a DAG. It fails to apply topological sort to find the hamiltonian path on the DAG. |
| 441462sols019 | 0 | The response proposes a different reduction than the ground truth. The forward direction doesn't create a cycle like the ground truth asks, and the backward direction does not make sense. |
| 5b6cd1sols000 | 0 | The LLM response is wrong. The ground truth is true, but the LLM's answer is false. |
| 5b6cd1sols001 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly identifies the statement as true and provides a clear and accurate explanation of the O(n log n) dynamic programming algorithm for weighted interval scheduling. It also correctly points out that the sorting and the dynamic programming components are O(n log n). |
| 5b6cd1sols002 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and explains why dividing the array into groups of 5, rather than 3, is necessary for a linear-time median-finding algorithm, aligning with the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols003 | 0 | The LLM answer is wrong. The time complexity would satisfy the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n²), which solves to Θ(n²) by the Master Theorem. |
| 5b6cd1sols004 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a correct explanation of why. The time complexity analysis is accurate and aligns with the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols005 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides the correct reasoning for the space complexity of the van Emde Boas tree. |
| 5b6cd1sols006 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that the potential energy should never go negative in the potential method for amortized analysis and provides a good explanation. |
| 5b6cd1sols007 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a correct explanation of why. |
| 5b6cd1sols008 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the statement as false. The ground truth states it's true because a skip list can have any height with a non-zero probability, while the LLM states that Omega(2n) is not a possible occurrence in skip list searching. |
| 5b6cd1sols009 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly identifies the answer as True when it should be False. The LLM incorrectly computes collisions for keys A and C, which should be 2/3 but is instead computed as 1/3. |
| 5b6cd1sols010 | 1 | The LLM points out the need for padding with zero which is equivalent to the ground truth. However, it includes extra explanations about powers of 2 that is not necessary. |
| 5b6cd1sols011 | 1 | The response suggests a balanced BST and segment tree for the problem. While these are valid data structures, they do not achieve the optimal time complexity of O(log log n) as stated in the ground truth, instead achieving O(log n). Thus, the response is only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols012 | 1 | The response gives an algorithm that uses dynamic array with doubling and lazy deletion. The insert operation has amortized O(1) time. However, the remove-bottom-half operation's time complexity is incorrect. It states the time complexity is O(0), while the ground truth is O(n). |
| 5b6cd1sols013 | 2 | The LLM response provides a correct description of a randomized algorithm for polynomial identity testing. The algorithm is based on evaluating the polynomials at a random point and comparing the results. This approach achieves the desired O(n) time complexity. The explanation includes details on how to choose a random evaluation point and the use of Horner's method for efficient polynomial evaluation, matching the ground truth's requirement of using a random value and O(n) evaluation time. |
| 5b6cd1sols014 | 2 | The response correctly explains why the algorithm will output YES when p(x) * q(x) = r(x). |
| 5b6cd1sols015 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct because it accurately proves that the randomized algorithm satisfies Property 2 by demonstrating that if p(x) * q(x) != r(x), then the probability that the algorithm incorrectly concludes p(x) * q(x) = r(x) is small. The reasoning provided closely follows the logic and key steps outlined in the ground truth, including discussing the degree of the polynomial, the random selection process, and the probability bound. |
| 5b6cd1sols016 | 1 | The response describes the general idea of using a random evaluation point to check polynomial equality. However, it only describes a single iteration and doesn't include the repetition needed to amplify the success probability to at least 1 - epsilon. The response has an error in the final condition on M, it should be 1/2\epsilon not epsilon. |
| 5b6cd1sols017 | 2 | The solution provides a correct definition of the dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the recurrence relation, base cases, and time complexity. |
| 5b6cd1sols018 | 2 | The solution correctly identifies the need to calculate range maximums for all four quadrants and then iterate through the valid cells to find the maximum product of the quadrant maximums. The time complexity is also correctly stated as O(nm). |
| 5b6cd1sols019 | 2 | The response correctly describes the O(m+n) algorithm to find the median of two sorted arrays. It correctly merges the arrays and returns the median of the merged array. |
| 5b6cd1sols020 | 2 | The LLM provides a correct algorithm for finding the median of two sorted arrays in O(log n) time when m = n. It correctly uses a binary search approach to find the partition points and then calculates the median based on those points. All steps are correct and explained well. |
| 5b6cd1sols021 | 2 | The response provides a correct algorithm for finding the median of two sorted arrays with the specified time complexity. The explanation is clear and includes the necessary steps for implementation. |
| c212dlsols000 | 0 | The response is completely wrong because it agrees with the question without pointing out the condition of independent events. |
| c212dlsols001 | 0 | The LLM answer incorrectly applies the Master Theorem, leading to an incorrect time complexity analysis and a wrong conclusion about the overall runtime. The correct time complexity, as indicated in the ground truth, is \(\Theta(n^2)\). |
| c212dlsols002 | 2 | The LLM's answer contains all the information provided in the ground truth answer, and provides extra correct, relevant information that adds value. Because of this, the answer is fully correct. |
| c212dlsols003 | 0 | The LLM states that both INSERT and DELETE-MIN operations typically have an amortized time complexity of \( O(\log n) \). While this is correct for standard binary heaps, the question refers to the amortized time complexity, which can be different with specific implementations or amortized analysis techniques. The LLM fails to acknowledge the possibility of O(0) amortized time for DELETE-MIN. Therefore, the answer is incorrect. |
| c212dlsols004 | 0 | The LLM does not answer with True or False. Moreover, it states that "the universal property can't be confirmed definitively", even though the problem can be solved with the given information. |
| c212dlsols005 | 0 | The LLM answers True when the correct answer is False. The LLM's explanation does not address the issue of cycles in the graph leading to infinitely many paths, and thus infinite products, which the algorithm would not correctly handle. |
| c212dlsols006 | 2 | The LLM provides the correct answer and a good explanation. |
| c212dlsols007 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a valid reason for why it is false. The justification is well-explained and accurate. |
| c212dlsols008 | 2 | The LLM's answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols009 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly identifies the statement as false and provides an incorrect justification regarding the time and message complexity. The ground truth is true. |
| c212dlsols010 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly claims that the described system securely verifies the file's integrity due to collision resistance. It overlooks the adversary's ability to replace both the file and its hash, rendering the verification useless. The ground truth correctly identifies this vulnerability. |
| c212dlsols011 | 0 | The LLM response answers 'True' which is incorrect. Furthermore, the explanation provides incorrect steps on how Alice, Bob, and Charlie would calculate the shared secret. In the steps, Alice, Bob, and Charlie are using information they would not have access to. For example, in the first step, Alice would not have access to $g^b$ and $g^c$ since she only publishes $g^a$. |
| c212dlsols012 | 2 | The answer is correct and provides a reasonable explanation, although it doesn't explicitly mention making implicit memory transfers explicit using LRU, it implicitly addresses it by explaining the difference in optimization approaches between cache-oblivious and external memory algorithms. |
| c212dlsols013 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false, and gives a reason why optimality in execution time does not guarantee optimality in memory transfers. |
| c212dlsols014 | 2 | The response is fully correct. The response correctly identifies that each node should store the sum of all salaries in the subtree rooted at each node and the count of all employees in the subtree rooted at each node. The response also correctly explains how to use this information to answer the AVERAGE(x) query in O(lg n) time. |
| c212dlsols015 | 2 | The LLM response correctly describes the modifications needed to the INSERT operation to maintain the size and sum of subtrees. It correctly states that when a node is inserted, we update the size and sum of its ancestors, and that when a node splits, we recompute the size and sum attributes of the split nodes and their parent. The justification for the O(lgn) worst-case running time is also correct. |
| c212dlsols016 | 2 | The LLM provides a fully correct answer, matching the ground truth explanation and final answer. |
| c212dlsols017 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It correctly sets up the inequality based on the given probability and solves for k in terms of n to achieve the desired high probability. The final result, \(k \geq \frac{c \log(n)}{\log(2)}\), matches the ground truth \(\alpha lg n\) since lg(n) is log base 2 of n, and c/log(2) is equivalent to alpha. |
| c212dlsols018 | 2 | The LLM response provided a detailed and correct derivation for the value of k. It also gave a correct final answer that matches the ground truth. The response also included an explanation for each step. |
| c212dlsols019 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies that lowest pi and highest tj should be considered. However, it does not provide a rigorous proof by swapping, which is the key to the ground truth. The explanation is high-level and intuitive but lacks the mathematical rigor of the ground truth proof. |
| c212dlsols020 | 1 | The LLM proposes a reasonable greedy algorithm, and the correctness argument is also reasonable. However, the LLM sorts teachers in decreasing order, which is the opposite of what the ground truth specifies. Also, the LLM assigns teacher i to piece i, whereas the ground truth assigns teacher n-k+i to piece i. |
| c212dlsols021 | 1 | The LLM's response uses binary search, which is correct. The LLM makes an error in its runtime analysis. Since we binary search over a space of size min(m, n), and each check takes O(n) time, the overall runtime is O(n log min(m, n)) + O(m log m + n log n) = O(n log n) + O(m log m). If we are only considering the case where m = O(n), then this simplifies to O(n log n). |
| c212dlsols022 | 0 | The response describes the method for creating a residual graph, but does not actually create the graph. The response does not give the correct answer. |
| c212dlsols023 | 0 | The response does not provide a valid path from source to sink. It only describes the process of finding the shortest augmenting path without providing the answer. It does not match the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols024 | 0 | The LLM response does not perform the augmentation or compute the new flow value. It gives a general description of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. |
| c212dlsols025 | 1 | The LLM response identifies the need to iterate through subsets of size k, similar to the ground truth. However, the approach to checking if a subset can be completed differs significantly, employing more complex matching algorithms where a simple marking method would suffice. Moreover, while the LLM correctly identifies the combinatorial factor, the final time complexity analysis is more complex than the ground truth due to the algorithm it suggests, which is unnecessary. |
| c212dlsols026 | 0 | The answer is incorrect. The LLM claims the algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), while the ground truth says it is not. The explanation provided by the LLM also incorrectly reasons about the time complexity required for an FPT algorithm. |
| c212dlsols027 | 2 | The answer correctly provides a reduction from 3D matching to the project assignment problem, showing that the latter is NP-hard. The explanation is clear and complete. |
| c212dlsols028 | 1 | The greedy algorithm described by the LLM is the LPT (Longest Processing Time) algorithm. While LPT is a valid greedy approximation for the problem, the ground truth describes a simpler (but also valid) greedy approach of assigning jobs in an arbitrary order to the least loaded machine. Thus the response is partially correct as it describes *a* correct algorithm but not the one in the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols029 | 1 | The response presents a slightly different argument than the ground truth, but it arrives at the correct 2-approximation result. The response uses the workload rather than the minimal time, and does not use the same argument from the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols030 | 1 | The response correctly identifies that S cannot contain more than one vertex of the form (v, i). However, it does not accurately prove that S must contain at least one vertex of the form (v, i). The proof provided is not detailed and relies on the vague claim that otherwise it would contradict maximality. It does not explicitly use the pigeonhole principle as suggested by the hint and the ground truth. The argument about maximality is correct in spirit but is not rigorous enough and misses key elements of the ground truth argument involving neighbors in G. |
| c212dlsols031 | 1 | The response proposes a valid distributed coloring algorithm. However, it doesn't explicitly leverage the MIS construction on the Cartesian product graph as outlined in the ground truth. While the response correctly identifies the key ideas of a distributed algorithm for vertex coloring, it misses the crucial detail of how the MIS construction can be used in the synchronous network. |
| c212dlsols032 | 1 | The time complexity is correctly identified as O(log n). However, the communication complexity calculation is more involved and not entirely accurate. The ground truth suggests O(E log n), while the response arrives at O(Δ^3 |V| log |V|). The response provides an attempt to incorporate \Delta, but doesn't succeed in matching the ground truth. |
