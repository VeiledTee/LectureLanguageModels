## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q1_0 | 2 | The LLM response correctly explains why alpha-beta pruning is not suitable for breadth-first search. It accurately describes the pruning mechanism's reliance on depth-first exploration and the limitations of breadth-first search in providing the necessary information for effective pruning. The explanation includes key points from the ground truth, such as the inefficiency of pruning and the increased memory requirements of BFS. It clearly indicates why alpha-beta cannot be generalized to work optimally with BFS. |
| q1_1 | 2 | The response correctly answers the question, matching the ground truth. It correctly identifies that alpha-beta can be generalized to progressive deepening and retain optimal answer. Advantages and disadvantages are correctly given. |
| q1_2 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS), which is equivalent to Progressive Deepening (PD) as the best algorithm. It also accurately describes when a visited list would be a good idea. The answer is fully correct. |
| q1_3 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies Uniform Cost Search as the optimal algorithm for the problem, and correctly explains why. The LLM response also correctly identifies that using an expanded list to prevent re-exploration of states, especially if the search space contains loops. Therefore, the answer is fully correct. |
| q1_4 | 2 | The LLM correctly determines that constraint propagation does not reduce the domains of any variables, matching the ground truth exactly. |
| q1_5 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the final domain of all five variables after full constraint propagation, matching the ground truth exactly. |
| q1_6 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. All the resulting domains of the variables are correctly inferred after assigning variable 1 to R and doing forward checking. |
| q1_7 | 0 | The response provides an explanation of backtracking but does not actually mark the search tree as requested in the prompt. Thus it does not answer the question asked. |
| q1_8 | 0 | The answer fails to give the sequence of attempted assignments according to BT-FC, and gets lost by trying to find the solution instead of mimicking the algorithm in the question. |
| q1_9 | 2 | The LLM correctly identified the sequence of assignments: 5=B, 2=R, 1=B, 3=B, 4=R, which aligns perfectly with the ground truth. It also accurately described the domain changes with each assignment. |
| q1_10 | 1 | The response got the domain mostly correct but did not include the 'empty' assignment. The response correctly identifies C2 is satisfied. It has a reasonable attempt at how constraints can be binary. It fails to mention that C1 cannot be specified as binary, but the given counterexample is a good explanation. |
| q1_11 | 0 | The correct answer is m*n + 1, because we must consider the option of not scheduling anything in the slot as well. Also, the LLM response hallucinates other parts of the question. |
| q1_12 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies that Constraint C2 is automatically satisfied. Other points are irrelevant for this question. |
| q1_13 | 1 | The response correctly identifies that constraint C1 cannot be expressed as a binary constraint. However, it incorrectly states that constraint C2 can be expressed as a binary constraint, and it is not entirely correct about C3 being a binary constraint. |
| q1_14 | 2 | The response completely and correctly answers the question. It accurately describes the domain, domain size, satisfied constraints, and whether binary constraints can be used. There are no mismatches. |
| q1_15 | 2 | The LLM's response is fully correct. The domain size of approximately (n^2)/2 per scientist matches the ground truth. |
| q1_16 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that C1 is satisfied by construction in formulation B, matching the ground truth. The explanation is clear and accurate. |
| q1_17 | 1 | The answer incorrectly states that C2 can not be represented as binary constraints. The ground truth states that it can by placing binary constraints between scientists to prevent instrument/time conflicts, and C3 can be enforced by requiring that if observations from different scientists occur at the same time slot, their targets do not conflict. |
| q1_18 | 1 | The LLM's response incorrectly states that C1 is necessarily satisfied and suggests it can be encoded with binary constraints. C1 requires that exactly two observations are scheduled for each scientist. This is not necessarily satisfied by the formulation itself; constraints are still needed to enforce this. Additionally, enforcing C1 requires constraints over n variables, not just binary constraints. C2 can also not be properly encoded with binary constraints. It requires constraints over all observations at the same time and instrument. Again, not just binary. C3 can also not be properly encoded with binary constraints for the same reasons. Ground truth specifies domain as {Granted, Rejected}. The LLM response specifies domain as {0, 1} or {scheduled, not scheduled}. While technically correct, the ground truth uses {Granted, Rejected} which is the more direct and expected response. Since parts 3 and 4 of the LLM response are incorrect, and part 1 does not match the ground truth, the response is only partially correct. |
| q1_19 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the domain size as 2. |
| q1_20 | 1 | The response correctly identifies that no constraints are automatically satisfied, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the rest of the response is not relevant to the prompt, as it was only asking about satisfied constraints, not the other aspects of the formulation. So, it's only partially correct. |
| q1_21 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies that C2 and C3 can be expressed as binary constraints. However, it incorrectly claims that C1 can be expressed as a binary constraint. The ground truth states that C1 requires global counting of Granted assignments per scientist and thus cannot be a binary constraint. The LLM provides a convoluted explanation that doesn't quite achieve the desired enforcement with only binary constraints. |
| q1_22 | 1 | The response contains the correct components: types of rocks already collected; time since departure from lander; current rover location; current battery charge level; and total weight of collected rocks. Thus, the response is fully correct. |
| q1_23 | 1 | The answer is mostly correct as it identifies all the components required for the goal test: collect all rock types, return to lander, and stay within the time limit. However, the answer includes an extra component about minimization, which is not part of the goal test. The goal test should only test whether a state satisfies the goal conditions. The minimization part is only part of the path cost. |
| q1_24 | 1 | The answer is only partially correct, listing move, charge and pick-up-rock, but failing to note that charge has no preconditions, and adding unnecessary conditions to the other operations. It also hallucinates a return to lander state, which was not requested. |
| q1_25 | 1 | The answer is partially correct because it identifies the costs associated with each action (charge, move, pick-up-rock). However, it doesn't fully match the ground truth. For charging, the ground truth specifies a cost of 0, while the response defines the cost as Time_spent. For move, the ground truth specifies cost proportional to distance, while the response gives a more complex equation with battery cost and travel time. For pick-up-rock, the response gives a cost that includes both battery cost and weight, but misses the simplification of the ground truth. |
| q1_26 | 1 | H1: Response states that this heuristic is useful, but GT states that this is inadmissible (overestimates cost). H2: Correctly recognizes this is computationally impractical. Response does not mention that this heuristic is inadmissible. H3: Response is too harsh on this heuristic. The GT states this is admissible but weak. |
| q1_27 | 1 | The LLM incorrectly identifies the algorithm as Depth First Search, when it should be Breadth First Search. The LLM correctly states that no heuristic is used, and that the least-cost path was not found. Because the algorithm is incorrect, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q1_28 | 0 | The algorithm and the heuristic are both wrong. The answer also contains extra conversation that is not expected in the final response. |
| q1_29 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly identifies the algorithm as Uniform Cost Search. The correct algorithm is A* Search with heuristic H1. It also incorrectly claims that the least-cost path was found. |
| q1_30 | 1 | The algorithm identified is incorrect. It should be Best First Search with H2. The answer also incorrectly asserts that UCS does not use a heuristic, when the question asks what heuristic was used *if any*. It correctly identifies whether the optimal path was found. |
| q1_31 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the algorithm as Depth First Search, notes that no heuristic is used, and correctly explains why DFS does not guarantee the least-cost path. The explanation is detailed and accurate. |
| q1_32 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect, and therefore the heuristic as well. It also incorrectly states that it did not find the least cost path. |
| q1_33 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies that nodes are visited with preference to nodes with the lowest heuristic values or costs, but does not identify it as uniform cost search. The LLM thinks a heuristic is in use but this is incorrect. LLM incorrectly concludes that it did not find the least cost path. |
