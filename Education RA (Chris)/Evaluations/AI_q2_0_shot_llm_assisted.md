## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q2_0 | 1 | The LLM response describes how to construct a decision tree. The root node it provides is wrong, though, as the best split according to the ground truth is f1 > 1.5. |
| q2_1 | 1 | The answer identifies that vertical and horizontal splits are needed. It correctly identifies one of the splits at y=0.5 but it does not get the x split correct. It also includes an additional split that is not present in the ground truth. |
| q2_2 | 1 | The response provides a general explanation of how to choose the top-level test in a decision tree, including discussing information gain and entropy. However, it doesn't explicitly state the chosen split (f1 > 1.5) or the computed average entropy (AE = 0.552) as the ground truth does. Therefore, it is only partially correct. |
| q2_3 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies the prediction as Positive. However, it includes extraneous information and unnecessary reasoning. The ground truth answer is much more concise. |
| q2_4 | 2 | The LLM response correctly describes the Voronoi diagram partitioning space around each point as the decision boundaries for 1-NN. |
| q2_5 | 0 | The response does not answer the question, it provides a general explanation of how to do nearest neighbors, but doesn't actually do the calculation and state the correct answer. |
| q2_6 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct prediction or the correct reasoning. It only explains the 3-NN algorithm in general terms without applying it to the specific problem. |
| q2_7 | 0 | The response fails to correctly simulate the perceptron algorithm steps to arrive at the final separator. The weight updates are incorrectly calculated and do not match the ground truth. |
| q2_8 | 0 | The response provides a general explanation of how a perceptron works and makes an assumption of what the weights are, instead of using the weights provided in the ground truth. |
| q2_9 | 1 | The LLM response provides a general overview of how a perceptron works but fails to directly answer the question about the specific result on the 5-point dataset from Problem 1. It acknowledges the lack of details from Problem 1 and offers a generalized description, which is partially relevant, but it doesn't definitively state the crucial point from the ground truth: "No convergence; data is not linearly separable." |
| q2_10 | 1 | The LLM correctly calculates the inputs to the sigmoid function (z values) and provides the general formula for the sigmoid output. However, it does not provide the numerical values as in the ground truth, only the formulas (e.g., it gives 1/(1+e) instead of 0.27). Therefore, it is partially correct. |
| q2_11 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct formula, nor does it come up with the correct answer. The response discusses the general backpropagation algorithm without providing the correct equation to use. Additionally, the response says that more information is needed to give an answer, but it really isn't. |
| q2_12 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. It accurately calculates all probabilities as per the ground truth, using Laplacian correction correctly and providing clear step-by-step explanations. |
| q2_13 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies x_3 as the most influential feature and provides a reasonable explanation based on the data provided. |
| q2_14 | 0 | The response suggests Linear Regression or Logistic Regression, while the ground truth suggests K-Nearest Neighbors. Therefore, the response is wrong. |
| q2_15 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies Decision Trees as the best algorithm and provides a good justification based on interpretability, which aligns with the ground truth. |
| q2_16 | 0 | The response suggests SGD, while the ground truth answer is Naive Bayes. While SGD handles high dimensionality and incremental updates, Naive Bayes is more directly suited to preference prediction and is the algorithm suggested in the ground truth. |
| q2_17 | 1 | The answer includes regression but not Neural Networks. It mentions linear regression and random forest regressor but the ground truth mentions only Neural Networks or Regression (non-linear modeling). |
| q2_18 | 1 | The response provides some relevant information about the Perceptron algorithm, but it doesn't directly address the question of "Error vs Complexity" in the specific terms of the ground truth. It mentions complexity in a general way but doesn't explicitly state that there is "No complexity penalty" or that the hypothesis class is fixed, as the ground truth indicates. Therefore, it's only partially correct. |
| q2_19 | 1 | The response describes the error and complexity trade-off in a linear SVM but doesn't explicitly state that the algorithm 'maximizes margin' or that it 'optimizes a criterion'. It explains the role of the regularization parameter C, which is related, but it doesn't directly match the concise points in the ground truth. |
| q2_20 | 0 | The LLM response discusses decision tree complexity and the tradeoff between bias and variance. It does not mention the ground truth's key idea that a fixed depth decision tree has a "fixed hypothesis class" or the concept of "approximating minimal error." |
| q2_21 | 0 | The response provides a general description of neural networks, which is not what the question asked for. The question requested for the 'complexity control' aspect of neural networks. |
| q2_22 | 1 | The LLM response provides a good overview of SVMs with a finite penalty parameter C, explaining the trade-off between model complexity and error. It accurately describes how C influences the decision boundary and the balance between training error and generalization. However, it does not directly mention the "complexity penalty" or "optimizes tradeoff" as stated in the ground truth. It explains the concept but misses the succinct wording. |
| q2_23 | 1 | The LLM correctly describes the output as piecewise constant, but doesn't mention that the jumps occur at the midpoints between points. It also doesn't provide a visualization, but it wasn't asked to. |
| q2_24 | 1 | The LLM provides a good explanation of how regression trees work with a leaf size of 1. However, it doesn't actually draw the regression outputs as requested. It describes how the tree is built and how it makes predictions, but it doesn't visually represent the stepwise constant regions that would be characteristic of a regression tree's output. Therefore, it is only partially correct. |
| q2_25 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies that a linear neural network will output a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) fit minimizing mean squared error (MSE). However, it doesn't explicitly state that the line minimizes MSE. The response is therefore only partially correct. |
| q2_26 | 0 | The response does not contain a visual depiction of the regression output for a multi-layer neural network, and instead describes how they generally work. |
| q2_27 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies that options b, c, and d correctly classify the points, while a does not. However, it does not consider the maximal margin criterion for SVM, which is critical for assessing if the separators satisfy SVM conditions. Thus, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q2_28 | 0 | The response fails to match the correct diagrams to the kernels. It describes the characteristics of each kernel correctly but does not provide the correct matching as per the ground truth. |
