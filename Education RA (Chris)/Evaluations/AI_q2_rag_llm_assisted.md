## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q2_0 | 0 | The LLM refused to answer. The correct answer should have included the structure of a decision tree, including the root test and subsequent branches based on the given data points. The LLM's refusal indicates a complete lack of relevant information, meriting a score of 0. |
| q2_1 | 0 | The LLM refuses to answer the question. |
| q2_2 | 0 | The LLM response does not align with the ground truth in explaining the top-level test choice. It suggests a feature selection based on completely separating positive and negative instances, which is not the correct methodology for decision tree construction. The ground truth indicates a computation of average entropy (AE) for candidate splits and choosing the split with the minimal AE, which is entirely absent in the LLM response. |
| q2_3 | 0 | The LLM response makes an incorrect prediction and therefore receives a score of 0. |
| q2_4 | 1 | The response describes Voronoi diagrams but does not actually produce one. It is partially correct since it correctly identifies Voronoi diagrams as the basis for 1-NN boundaries. |
| q2_5 | 0 | The LLM provides a general explanation of the 1-NN algorithm but fails to provide the correct answer, which is 'Positive' because the closest neighbor is (1,0). The LLM also states that the training data is not specified, when it actually is. |
| q2_6 | 0 | The LLM response gets the nearest neighbors wrong, and therefore the classification is incorrect. The correct neighbors would be (1,0), (0,0), (2,-2), resulting in a positive classification. |
| q2_7 | 1 | The LLM response describes the general concept of the perceptron algorithm but doesn't produce the separator (0, 1, 2) as in the ground truth. It misses the crucial part of weight update process, only stating the update mechanism in theory instead of applying to the data points. |
| q2_8 | 1 | The answer correctly predicts the class as negative. However, it provides a somewhat vague justification without explicitly stating the calculation of the margin or showing that the margin is negative. It also uses an incorrect equation for the decision boundary. |
| q2_9 | 0 | The answer is incorrect. It fails to mention the non-convergence of the perceptron algorithm on non-linearly separable data, as specified in the ground truth. Instead, it incorrectly suggests a specific decision boundary and classification. |
| q2_10 | 2 | The LLM response is fully correct. The sigmoid outputs for each of the points are computed correctly, and the calculations are shown clearly. |
| q2_11 | 0 | The response does not calculate the correct value for \(\Delta w_2\). It provides the formulas but doesn't arrive at the correct numerical answer or show the work to get there. Additionally the final equation provided is wrong. It does not have \(w_2\) on both sides of the equation. |
| q2_12 | 0 | The response contains errors in all three probability calculations, with values not matching the ground truth. All three probabilities were computed incorrectly. |
| q2_13 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies x_3 as the most influential feature and provides a valid reason. |
| q2_14 | 0 | The LLM response provided no information about the correct answer, so it is wrong. |
| q2_15 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies decision trees as a good algorithm and provides a justification that aligns with the ground truth (interpretable). |
| q2_16 | 0 | The ground truth answer is Naive Bayes. The response suggests Perceptron, which is incorrect. |
| q2_17 | 1 | The LLM suggests linear regression, while the ground truth suggests neural networks or non-linear regression. The LLM response is thus only partially correct. |
| q2_18 | 0 | The response provides a lot of general information about the perceptron algorithm, but it fails to address the specific questions asked in the ground truth: fixed hypothesis class and complexity penalty. Therefore, it's completely wrong. |
| q2_19 | 0 | The response does not mention that Linear SVM uses a complexity penalty to maximize the margin or that it optimizes a criterion. It gives a general description of Linear SVM which is not what the question asks. |
| q2_20 | 0 | The response does not align with the ground truth, which states that decision trees with fixed depth have a fixed hypothesis class and approximate minimal error. The response provides a general description of decision trees but does not address the specific points mentioned in the ground truth. |
| q2_21 | 1 | The answer provides some details about neural networks but doesn't directly address the question of fixed architecture and lack of explicit complexity control as stated in the ground truth. The response discusses overfitting and weights but does not explicitly mention the fixed architecture. |
| q2_22 | 0 | The response does not directly address the prompt. The prompt asked for how SVM handles the error vs complexity tradeoff, and the response is a general description of SVM. |
| q2_23 | 0 | The LLM response states it cannot answer the question, and does not provide any information related to the ground truth. Therefore, it is incorrect. |
| q2_24 | 0 | The response states that it cannot answer the question. |
| q2_25 | 0 | The LLM states that it does not know the answer. This is completely incorrect. |
| q2_26 | 0 | The LLM fails to provide any answer, thus it is completely wrong. |
| q2_27 | 0 | The LLM's response is completely wrong. It incorrectly identifies which separators are valid, misinterprets the SVM conditions, and provides inaccurate justifications for each separator. None of the classifications align with the ground truth. |
| q2_28 | 0 | The response does not attempt to match the kernels to specific diagrams as required by the question. Instead, it gives a general description of the type of boundaries that each kernel would create. |
