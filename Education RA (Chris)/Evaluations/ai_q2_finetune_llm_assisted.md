## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q2_0 | 1 | The LLM response only gets the root test partly correct. It identifies x_1 as a relevant feature, and the 1.5 threshold is correct but the splitting is not perfectly accurate with respect to the given data points and ground truth. It also incorrectly classifies the points that should belong to the right branch (False). |
| q2_1 | 0 | The LLM response does not provide a valid answer for this question. It gives some statements, but does not state the decision boundaries as stated in the ground truth. |
| q2_2 | 1 | The response describes the general principle of choosing a top-level test in decision trees using entropy but doesn't provide specific details or calculations related to the given data points as the ground truth does. It mentions minimizing the weighted average of entropy (which is correct) but doesn't mention the specific split (f1 > 1.5) and its corresponding average entropy (AE = 0.552). So it is only partially correct. |
| q2_3 | 0 | The LLM's response is incorrect; the correct class prediction is Positive, but the LLM predicted Negative. |
| q2_4 | 1 | The response generally describes the concept of the Voronoi diagram, which is used to define 1-NN boundaries, particularly mentioning equidistant points. However, it does not explicitly state "Voronoi diagram partitioning space around each point". |
| q2_5 | 0 | The answer is wrong. The closest neighbor is not (1, -1.5). Also, the predicted class is wrong. |
| q2_6 | 0 | The answer is completely wrong. It misidentifies the neighbors and the resulting classification. |
| q2_7 | 0 | The response does not correctly explain the perceptron algorithm's steps or the updates to the weight vector based on misclassified points. It misses several crucial update steps and contains inaccuracies. The ground truth outlines the complete weight update process, which this response fails to capture. |
| q2_8 | 0 | The LLM's response has the wrong class (it says positive, the correct answer is negative). It also has the wrong net input and margin values. Therefore the answer is incorrect. |
| q2_9 | 0 | The LLM response describes the classification error rather than non-convergence due to non-linearly separable data. This does not match the ground truth answer. |
| q2_10 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the formula for calculating the weighted sum and sigmoid function. It also correctly computes the 's' values for each point and the sigmoid value for (2,-2). However, it does not provide the final numerical sigmoid values for (-1,0) and (1,0), only indicating \(\sigma(-1)\) and \(\sigma(1)\) respectively. This makes the answer partially correct. |
| q2_11 | 0 | The LLM's response bears no resemblance to the ground truth. It makes use of extraneous computations (such as calculating "), and computes incorrect values for the few variables it does share with the ground truth. The final answer is orders of magnitude off from the correct answer. |
| q2_12 | 1 | The LLM's answer is mostly correct but contains a minor error in calculating P(x_3=0|y=0). The LLM states P(x_3=0|y=0) = (4+1)/(6+2) = 5/8, whereas the ground truth specifies P(x_3=0|y=0) = 1 - (2+1)/(6+2) = 5/8. Since the final result is the same despite a difference in the calculation method, this is considered a minor error and the response is marked as partially correct. |
| q2_13 | 0 | The answer provided by the LLM is wrong. The most influential feature is x3, not x2. |
| q2_14 | 1 | The response correctly identifies k-NN as a suitable algorithm. The justification mentions load time (which relates to training) and fixed answer time which is partially related to the reasoning in the ground truth but does not exactly match. |
| q2_15 | 2 | The answer correctly identifies Decision Trees as the appropriate algorithm and provides the correct justification. |
| q2_16 | 0 | The answer suggests Linear Regression, while the ground truth suggests Naive Bayes. The justification provided does not align with the ground truth's reasoning for choosing Naive Bayes, which emphasizes handling high dimensions and incremental updates. Therefore, the response is incorrect. |
| q2_17 | 0 | The response suggests linear regression, while the ground truth specifies Neural Networks or non-linear Regression. |
| q2_18 | 0 | The response is incorrect and does not match the ground truth. |
| q2_19 | 1 | The LLM response identifies the weight minimization aspect of linear SVM which aligns with the complexity penalty mentioned in the ground truth (maximizing margin). However, it doesn't explicitly state the criterion optimization, making it only partially correct. |
| q2_20 | 0 | The response gives L (Bias) and C (Variance), which does not match the ground truth which says, "Fixed hypothesis class. Approximates minimal error." |
| q2_21 | 0 | The LLM response does not address the prompt, which asks about the algorithm's complexity control, not its error characteristics. |
| q2_22 | 0 | The response 'high, low' does not relate to the ground truth answer of 'Complexity penalty (soft margin). Optimizes tradeoff.' Therefore, the answer is completely wrong. |
| q2_23 | 1 | The LLM response describes a piecewise constant function, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states that segments are centered around the y-value of a single point. 2-NN should average 2 nearest neighbors. |
| q2_24 | 1 | The response partially matches the ground truth. It mentions "piecewise constant function" which aligns with the "stepwise constant regions" in the ground truth. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the regions match data partitions, which is a key aspect of regression trees. Therefore, it's only partially correct. |
| q2_25 | 1 | The answer mentions a line, which is the key aspect of a linear neural network's regression output. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the minimization of MSE, making it partially correct but not fully complete. |
| q2_26 | 1 | The response describes the capabilities of a multi-layer neural network to approximate functions, aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on approximating data trends. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the smoothness of the curve. Thus, it is only partially correct. |
| q2_27 | 0 | The LLM response is completely wrong, as it incorrectly identifies whether the separators satisfy SVM conditions. It fails to recognize the valid separator and incorrectly marks others as failing based on unspecified criteria. |
| q2_28 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the matching between quadratic/cubic polynomial kernels and their boundaries. However, the matching between RBF kernels and boundaries are not fully correct. While the answer mentions that option (d) will have a smoother boundary than (c), it does not accurately match the boundaries A and C to the corresponding RBF sigma values. |
