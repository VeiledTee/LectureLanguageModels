|-------------|-------|----------|
| 441462sols000 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a detailed explanation of why Strassen's algorithm's techniques are not applicable to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The explanation is accurate and comprehensive. |
| 441462sols001 | 2 | The response correctly identifies the time complexities of both algorithms and performs a correct comparison. It also correctly concludes that Johnson's is faster for the specified graph density, leading to a fully correct classification. |
| 441462sols002 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and accurately explains why a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a more appropriate representation of dependencies in dynamic programming than a directed rooted tree. It also provides a good example. |
| 441462sols003 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly states the answer is False when it should be True. The explanation also does not align with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols004 | 0 | The response incorrectly claims that a graph with n vertices and n edges is already a tree. The ground truth correctly identifies that there is exactly one cycle. The answer fails to recognize the cycle. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect. |
| 441462sols005 | 2 | The response correctly identifies the statement as true and provides a correct justification that aligns with the ground truth. The algorithm's runtime is O((V+E)|f|) because each iteration can increase the flow by at least 1, leading to O(|f|) iterations. |
| 441462sols006 | 0 | The LLM's answer is incorrect and provides a flawed justification based on a misunderstanding of the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem. The ground truth correctly identifies that increasing the capacity of one minimum cut does not guarantee an increase in maximum flow if another minimum cut exists with unchanged capacity. |
| 441462sols007 | 2 | The answer is fully correct because it identifies the statement as false and provides a valid explanation consistent with the ground truth. |
| 441462sols008 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a comprehensive explanation that aligns with the ground truth. The response details the implication of P=NP on NP-complete problems like 3SAT, stating that they would be solvable in polynomial time. Therefore, the answer is fully correct. |
| 441462sols009 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a valid justification. The explanation clarifies why selecting the vertex with maximum degree repeatedly does not guarantee a 2-approximation for the Vertex Cover problem. It also gives an example of a star graph that illustrates this issue. |
| 441462sols010 | 0 | The LLM response fails to draw the shortest path as requested in the problem. It only provides a high-level overview of how to approach the problem without actually solving it for the given graph, which is a significant deviation from the ground truth that provides a specific visual solution. |
| 441462sols011 | 0 | The response does not provide the correct shortest path in the graph provided in the PDF. Instead, it gives a generic algorithm for solving a similar problem. The response does not contain any part of the ground truth answer. |
| 441462sols012 | 1 | The response gives a general approach to solving the problem using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a reasonable strategy. However, the approach of creating a new graph G' with vertices duplicated for every possible mile range up to m seems unnecessarily complex and potentially inefficient. The ground truth provides a more efficient algorithm using Johnson's algorithm and constructing a graph G' with only charging stations as vertices. The response does not achieve the O(VE + V^2 log V) time complexity. |
| 441462sols013 | 2 | The solution is completely correct, as it contains the correct greedy algorithm, a runtime analysis, and a proof of correctness. |
| 441462sols014 | 2 | The LLM gives the correct answer and explains the reasoning clearly. |
| 441462sols015 | 1 | The response uses binary search, as suggested by the ground truth. The upper bound mentioned in the ground truth is O(E+m) (or O(V+m), O(Em)), but the response uses m|V|. The explanation of feasibility is correct, as is the mention of using max flow. The final complexity is not the same as ground truth. Overall partially correct. |
| 441462sols016 | 1 | The response suggests a correct high-level approach using max-flow and binary search. However, it fails to provide the crucial details of the graph construction (layered network with specific edge capacities) and a clear runtime analysis based on the graph construction, which are central to the ground truth solution. It mentions using algorithms such as Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm, but does not tie the complexity of those to the specifics of the problem. This lacks specifics, so it can only be considered partially correct. |
| 441462sols017 | 1 | The response is partially correct. It correctly models the problem as a flow network and describes the vertices and edges. However, it incorrectly connects the source to the day vertices instead of the person vertices. It also misses a key step in the ground truth, which is to check flow on edges (p_i, d_j) instead of (u_i, v_j). |
| 441462sols018 | 1 | The response correctly describes the cycle detection using DFS. The response fails to provide a polynomial-time algorithm to detect Hamiltonian Paths in a DAG. |
| 441462sols019 | 1 | The response makes an attempt at a valid reduction, but the description of the graph G' and the Hamiltonian path construction within G' are not entirely accurate or aligned with the ground truth. It introduces a vertex 'u' and bidirectional edges, which is a different approach than the ground truth's use of three vertices (U1, U2, U3) to create a cycle, and unidirectional edges. Also the ground truth provides a more accurate approach to creating a new Hamiltonian path. Therefore, while the response demonstrates some understanding, it is only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols000 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly marks the statement as false and provides a counterexample where the intervals are not compatible with the earliest finish time algorithm, which is a critical misunderstanding of the problem's conditions. |
| 5b6cd1sols001 | 0 | The response incorrectly identifies the statement as False. The ground truth states that weighted interval scheduling can be solved in O(n log n) time using dynamic programming. |
| 5b6cd1sols002 | 0 | The LLM states that the prompt question is true, whereas the ground truth states that it is false. |
| 5b6cd1sols003 | 2 | The response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a detailed explanation using the Master Theorem to justify why the overall time complexity would be Θ(n²) instead of O(n² log n). All steps are clear and mathematically accurate. |
| 5b6cd1sols004 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false, and the explanation for the runtime complexity aligns with the ground truth. The analysis of the runtime and the final conclusion are accurate and well-reasoned. |
| 5b6cd1sols005 | 2 | The LLM's response is fully correct. The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a comprehensive explanation, highlighting the space complexity trade-off and contrasting it with the problem statement's assertion. |
| 5b6cd1sols006 | 0 | The LLM answer is incorrect. It states that the potential energy can go negative at intermediate points, which contradicts the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols007 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a clear, accurate explanation of why the auxiliary space is O(log n) due to the recursion depth, matching the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols008 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly labels the statement as false and provides an inaccurate justification. It states that searching in a skip list cannot take \(\Omega(2n)\) time. The prompt states that the search could take \(\Omega(2n)\) with nonzero probability, making the statement true. |
| 5b6cd1sols009 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that the hash family is not universal. It supports its conclusion by checking pairs of keys and determining the probability of collision, which is greater than 1/m for at least one pair. The steps are clear and logically sound, making the response fully correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols010 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies that Ben needs to pad a and b with zeroes to avoid aliasing in the frequency domain when performing polynomial multiplication using FFT. This aligns with the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols011 | 1 | The response suggests a balanced BST with O(log n) time complexity for each operation, while the ground truth specifies a van Emde Boas tree (VEB tree) with O(lg lg(n)) time complexity for each operation. Thus, the response is partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols012 | 0 | The data structure and algorithm are different from the ground truth. The amortized analysis is not correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols013 | 2 | The LLM's response provides a correct randomized algorithm for polynomial verification, achieving O(n) time complexity. It clearly outlines the steps: choosing a random point, evaluating polynomials, calculating the product, and comparing evaluations. The analysis of correctness and error probability is also accurate. The response aligns well with the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols014 | 1 | The response explains the algorithm and refers to Schwartz-Zippel Lemma, which is relevant. However, it does not directly state that if p(x)q(x)=r(x) then both sides evaluate to the same thing for any input x. It focuses more on the converse and the probability of error. |
| 5b6cd1sols015 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the key concepts, such as using the Schwartz-Zippel lemma and defining h(x) = p(x) * q(x) - r(x). However, it does not provide the explicit probability bound requested in the ground truth. It states Pr[h(x)=0] <= 2n/|F|, which is a good starting point, but it doesn't connect this to the suggested field size of 4n in the original problem. Therefore, the response is only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols016 | 1 | The response contains the correct high-level idea of polynomial identity testing using a random value. It provides a reasonable analysis of the error probability and how to select the domain size. However, it does not provide the boosting step via repetition mentioned in the ground truth. Therefore, it is only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols017 | 2 | The response provides a correct dynamic programming algorithm to compute the maximum tastiness value in the top-left quadrant of each cell (i, j) in O(nm) time. It correctly defines the recursive relation, initialization, and boundary conditions, matching the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols018 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the need to pre-compute maximum tastiness values for each quadrant using dynamic programming. It outlines the steps to create four auxiliary matrices (TL, BL, TR, BR) and calculates the maximum dish tastiness. However, the recurrence relation provided for calculating TL[i][j] is incorrect and would not give the correct maximum within the quadrant. Also, the max_tastiness calculation is wrong as it uses TL[i][j] * BL[i][j] * TR[i][j] * BR[i][j], which calculates the product of maximum elements ending at (i,j) rather than using the elements at the boundary of the quadrants relative to (i,j) as suggested in the ground truth. Thus, it's only partially correct. |
| 5b6cd1sols019 | 2 | The response provides a correct and complete algorithm for finding the median of two sorted arrays in O(m+n) time. It accurately describes the merging process and the subsequent median calculation, aligning with the ground truth. |
| 5b6cd1sols020 | 1 | The LLM response provides a correct and efficient (O(log n)) algorithm using a binary search approach. It correctly identifies the need for partitioning and maintaining properties to find the median. However, it is more complicated than the ground truth answer. |
| 5b6cd1sols021 | 2 | The LLM response presents a fully correct and efficient algorithm for finding the median of two sorted arrays in O(log(min(m, n))) time. It correctly uses binary search and partitioning to achieve the desired time complexity. It also handles edge cases, such as when either i or j are 0, or equal to m or n respectively, by assigning - is defined. The ground truth does not provide a full algorithm but this response successfully provides one. |
| c212dlsols000 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly states the answer is True. The ground truth states that the answer is False because the two steps must be independent, which is a condition that is not stated in the question. |
| c212dlsols001 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly states that the answer is true. The ground truth answer is false, with a runtime of \Theta(n^2). |
| c212dlsols002 | 2 | The LLM correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a good explanation. This aligns well with the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols003 | 0 | The LLM's answer is wrong because the ground truth claims it is true. The LLM claims the answer is false because DELETE-MIN cannot be performed in O(0) amortized time. |
| c212dlsols004 | 1 | The LLM correctly identifies the definition of a universal hash family. However, it fails to apply it correctly because the table defining the hash functions is missing, and it cannot draw a conclusion. The LLM should have requested the table to provide a definite answer. |
| c212dlsols005 | 0 | The LLM claims the statement is true but the ground truth specifies that the statement is false. The justification provided by the LLM is incorrect as well. |
| c212dlsols006 | 2 | The LLM response provides a correct explanation of why negating edge weights and finding the MST yields the maximum spanning tree. It clearly explains the relationship between minimizing the negated weights and maximizing the original weights. |
| c212dlsols007 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a clear explanation. It highlights the uniqueness of the MST and explains why the second-lowest weight spanning tree might not be unique due to different edge replacements leading to the same total weight. |
| c212dlsols008 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identified the answer as false. It also provided the correct explanation of what d_{uv}^{(k)} represents in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm which matches the ground truth answer. |
| c212dlsols009 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies the statement as True, but the explanation is not as concise or directly related to the ground truth solution (BFS tree and convergecast). The explanation focuses on general message propagation and complexity arguments without explicitly mentioning the specific algorithm involving BFS and convergecast as described in the ground truth. Thus it is only partially correct. |
| c212dlsols010 | 0 | The LLM incorrectly claims the statement is true, while the ground truth states that the statement is false and explains that an adversary can replace the file and the hash of that file. |
| c212dlsols011 | 2 | The LLM response correctly identifies the statement as false and provides a good explanation as to why. The explanation given in the LLM response is similar to the ground truth, making it fully correct. |
| c212dlsols012 | 0 | The answer incorrectly states that the statement is False. The correct answer is True. The explanation provided does not align with the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols013 | 2 | The LLM correctly answers false and provides a reasonable explanation as to why, it touches on the definition of cache-oblivious and why minimizing time complexity does not always minimize memory transfers. There are no specific matches, but the overall idea is in line with the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols014 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies that each node needs to store the subtree size and subtree salary sum. However, it lacks the description of how to efficiently use this data to answer the query. The method described to traverse the tree does not correctly ensure an O(lg n) runtime. |
| c212dlsols015 | 1 | The response correctly identifies the need to augment the tree with `sum` and `count` at each node and the update process during insertion. However, it does not explicitly discuss the recomputation of `sum` and `count` during node splits, which is a crucial part of maintaining the augmented information in a 2-3 tree, so it is partially correct. It correctly states that the run time is O(lgn). |
| c212dlsols016 | 2 | The LLM's response is fully correct. It correctly applies linearity of expectation and calculates the correct probability of remembering each event. It arrives at the correct expression for the expected number of remembered appointments: n * (1 - (0.5)^k). |
| c212dlsols017 | 2 | The LLM response correctly calculates the number of reminders needed, k, in terms of n and a constant c, to ensure Forrest remembers the event with high probability (1 - 1/n^c). It provides a clear and well-explained solution, demonstrating a good understanding of the problem and the underlying probability concepts. It is fully consistent with the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols018 | 2 | The LLM provides a correct and detailed derivation of the result with all the steps. All the math is correct and leads to the correct result with the same Big O complexity. |
| c212dlsols019 | 1 | The response provides a proof by contradiction arguing that one should consider only the k lowest $p_i$s and the k highest $t_j$s. The logic is sound, but is a bit verbose and less succinct than the ground truth answer. |
| c212dlsols020 | 1 | The response provides a greedy algorithm but it is not the most efficient one, as suggested in the ground truth. It does not use the insight that only specific teachers should be considered for specific pieces to achieve exactly k pieces. The algorithm attempts to assign teachers and self-learning time to pieces in a general way, which might not lead to learning exactly k pieces, thus deviating from the optimal strategy outlined in the ground truth. |
| c212dlsols021 | 1 | The response does not implement a binary search which is a vital component of the ground truth. The response suggests sorting, which is on the right track, but then proposes a complex allocation strategy instead of using binary search with the (b) function as a black box. |
| c212dlsols022 | 0 | The response does not answer the question. The response describes how to construct a residual graph but does not actually construct the residual graph for the flow network in question. |
| c212dlsols023 | 0 | The answer does not include the correct shortest augmenting path in the provided flow network. It describes the Edmonds-Karp algorithm but doesn't identify the correct path. The correct paths are s→3→2→5→t or s→3→2→6→t. The LLM response gives a generalized response. |
| c212dlsols024 | 0 | The response does not perform the augmentation or calculate the value of the resulting flow, as requested by the question. It only describes the steps of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm in general terms. |
| c212dlsols025 | 1 | The LLM identifies the correct approach of enumerating subsets of k projects. The LLM incorrectly describes the feasibility check of each subset: it suggests checking if the number of employees equals the sum of employees for each project, which is not sufficient to determine feasibility (it doesn't account for double assignments). The time complexity is also not fully correct (the LLM misses the m factor inside the binomial). |
| c212dlsols026 | 0 | The response does not answer the question. It provides a general discussion of FPT, but it does not discuss the runtime from part (a) at all. |
| c212dlsols027 | 2 | The answer correctly shows a reduction from 3D matching to the problem. The mapping of employees to projects and the argument about polynomial time are correct. |
| c212dlsols028 | 2 | The response correctly and completely describes the greedy approximation algorithm for the problem, matching all the key steps and logic of the ground truth. It provides a clear explanation of the algorithm's steps, including sorting the jobs, initializing machines, and greedily assigning jobs to minimize the maximum completion time. Additionally, it mentions the approximation ratio, indicating a good understanding of the algorithm's performance. |
| c212dlsols029 | 1 | The response provides a high-level overview of why the greedy algorithm is a 2-approximation, highlighting key components like the lower bound on the optimal makespan and the algorithm's balancing approach. However, it lacks the specific mathematical steps and rigorous proof found in the ground truth, particularly around how the last assigned job, t_{i^*}, contributes to the makespan and the explicit connection to the lower bound L. While it correctly states the lower bound and aims to show T_alg <= 2*T_opt, the reasoning is more descriptive than mathematically precise, missing the critical link involving T_l^* and the detailed bounding argument. So, the answer is partially correct. |
| c212dlsols030 | 1 | The response starts by correctly stating that the independent set can contain at most one vertex from each clique. It then argues that since S is maximal, it must contain exactly one vertex from each clique. However, the reasoning for this is not as rigorous as the ground truth. The ground truth uses a proof by contradiction and the Pigeonhole Principle to demonstrate that if S contained none of the vertices for some v, it would be possible to include one without breaking the independence condition, contradicting the maximality of S. The response does not provide this level of detail. |
| c212dlsols031 | 1 | The LLM proposes a valid coloring algorithm using the available colors of neighbors. While the correctness argument is sound, it does not explain how to translate to the cartesian product of G with a clique of size delta + 1, which the ground truth emphasizes. So, the answer is partially correct. |
| c212dlsols032 | 1 | The time complexity matches the ground truth except for the simplification. The communication complexity does not completely match the ground truth. |
