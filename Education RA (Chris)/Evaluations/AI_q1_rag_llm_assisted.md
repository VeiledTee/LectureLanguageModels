## Detailed Results
| Question ID | Score | Comments |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| q1_0 | 1 | The LLM response indicates the correct answer. However, it states that breadth-first search guarantees finding the optimal solution. This is not completely correct. Breadth-first search does not have the benefit of early pruning from the left-most subtrees, so it takes longer to find the optimal solution compared to alpha-beta pruning. |
| q1_1 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies that alpha-beta can be generalized to progressive deepening to find the optimal answer. It also mentions the advantages of depth-first and breadth-first search, but not in the context of alpha-beta. The answer is missing the key aspects of the ground truth, such as it wasting some work but being a small fraction of the total and ensuring a reasonable move is available in timed situations. The given answer also includes disadvantages. |
| q1_2 | 0 | The response suggests A* which is incorrect given the prompt. A* is appropriate when action costs are different, but the prompt specifies all actions have the same cost. It does not mention progressive deepening, the correct answer. |
| q1_3 | 1 | The LLM suggests A* search, which is related to Uniform Cost Search but relies on a heuristic. While A* could be applicable if a good heuristic is available, the ground truth specifically mentions Uniform Cost Search. The LLM's discussion of visited/expanded lists has some relevant points, but the primary focus is on A* rather than Uniform Cost Search as the core algorithm. |
| q1_4 | 2 | The response is fully correct. The domains of all variables remain unchanged after constraint propagation, as indicated in the ground truth. |
| q1_5 | 0 | The provided answer is completely wrong, as the full constraint propagation was not executed and no variables were correctly inferred. |
| q1_6 | 1 | The answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies that variable 2 should have domain {B}. However, the domain of variable 3 and variable 4 are incorrect. Variable 4 should have domain {B} and variable 3 should have domain {R,B}. |
| q1_7 | 0 | The response describes CSP and backtracking but does not mark the search tree as requested in the prompt. It doesn't provide the correct solution. |
| q1_8 | 1 | The LLM response correctly identifies the sequence of assignments until the first backtrack. It correctly lists 1=R and 2=B, and 1=B, 2=R, 3=B, 4=R, 5=B. However, the LLM makes a mistake by stating that the domain of 3 becomes empty. In reality, the domain of 5 becomes empty, causing the backtrack. Additionally, the LLM claims that assigning 1=B leads to a consistent assignment for all variables, but this is only partially true, as the algorithm still needs to assign values to 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q1_9 | 0 | The LLM fails to use dynamic ordering and doesn't follow the BT-FC algorithm. It doesn't provide the step-by-step assignments as requested in the format '5 = B -> 2 = R ...' but instead provides a final assignment. The provided assignment is also not correct according to BT-FC. |
| q1_10 | 0 | The response is incorrect. The domain is not all possible combinations of target, instrument, and time slot. The domain is the set of observations requesting that instrument/time slot plus an 'empty' value. The size of the domain is also incorrect. C1 is not necessarily satisfied. Constraints cannot be specified as binary constraints. |
| q1_11 | 0 | The correct answer for the size of the domain is m*n+1 (or m*n). The model response says the size of the domain is 3k. Therefore, this is an incorrect answer. |
| q1_12 | 1 | The model correctly identifies that C2 is automatically satisfied. However, it incorrectly claims that C3 is automatically satisfied and it misinterprets what the domain/variables represent, and subsequently answers the other parts incorrectly as well. |
| q1_13 | 1 | The response partially aligns with the ground truth. It correctly identifies that C3 can be modeled as a binary constraint. However, it incorrectly claims that C1 can be expressed as a binary constraint. It states that "C1 can be represented as a binary constraint between two variables representing the two chosen observations for a scientist." which is incorrect based on the ground truth since C1 requires checking all assignments simultaneously to ensure exactly two observations per scientist. |
| q1_14 | 1 | The LLM response provides the correct domain and size. However, it incorrectly claims that C3 is necessarily satisfied and its explanation regarding C2 and binary constraints is not totally correct according to the ground truth. |
| q1_15 | 1 | The value provided is n choose 2, which is equivalent to n(n-1)/2 which is approximately n^2/2. The answer also states that C2 is necessarily satisfied, but this is not true. C3 is correctly identified as not necessarily satisfied. Finally, the explanation of binary constraints is unclear, and seems incorrect. |
| q1_16 | 1 | The answer correctly identifies that constraint C1 is satisfied. However, it incorrectly claims that C3 is satisfied and that the constraints can be specified as binary constraints. Therefore, the answer is only partially correct. |
| q1_17 | 1 | The answer is mostly correct, but constraint C3 is not necessarily satisfied by this formulation. While the targets must be the same within a scientist's observations, there is no guarantee that different scientists have the same target. Also, C1 is satisfied because of the domain. |
| q1_18 | 0 | The response is completely wrong. The domain is {Granted, Rejected}. The given answer makes no sense. |
| q1_19 | 0 | The ground truth answer states the domain size is 2. The LLM answer states the domain size is mn * k * 3. This is completely wrong, and thus the answer receives a score of 0. |
| q1_20 | 0 | The response is completely wrong. The domain size is wrong, no constraints are necessarily satisfied, and the constraints cannot be binary. |
| q1_21 | 0 | The LLM is completely incorrect about constraints being satisfied because of the formulation. It also incorrectly states C1 can be specified as a binary constraint, and it fails to provide a counterexample. |
| q1_22 | 0 | The answer includes extraneous information (current lander location, weight of rocks at current location, cost to traverse the current location, time since last charged, current day, total battery capacity, distance to lander) in the state representation. It misses the conciseness requirement, and includes variables not listed in the ground truth. |
| q1_23 | 1 | The answer captures the essence of the goal test but includes minimizing weight and distance, which is an objective, not part of the goal condition itself. The inclusion of mathematical notation, while potentially helpful, also deviates from a direct statement of the goal conditions. |
| q1_24 | 1 | The response is partially correct. It identifies the main actions: driving, collecting rocks, and charging batteries. However, the preconditions and effects are not precisely aligned with the ground truth. The "return to lander" action is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth as a separate action but is implied within the move action. |
| q1_25 | 1 | The LLM's response has some overlap with the ground truth but contains some incorrect information and misinterprets certain elements of the problem, so the answer is partially correct. Charging cost should be zero, moving cost proportional to distance, and picking up rock cost \alpha times the weight of the rock. |
| q1_26 | 1 | The response provides some reasoning for why each heuristic is useful or not, but the specific reasons given are not entirely correct compared to the ground truth. For H1, it misses the key point about inadmissibility. For H2, it doesn't mention computational impracticality. For H3, it gets the admissibility correct but the rationale provided is a bit off. So, partially correct. |
| q1_27 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect (Depth First Search instead of Breadth First Search). The explanation for not finding the least-cost path is also incorrect as it is based on the wrong algorithm. |
| q1_28 | 0 | The LLM response incorrectly identifies the algorithm as Depth First Search. The correct algorithm is Best First Search with heuristic H1. Therefore, the entire answer is incorrect. |
| q1_29 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect. The explanation for why the algorithm failed to find the optimal path is also incorrect and based on the wrong algorithm. |
| q1_30 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect. Also, the explanation given for why the result is not optimal is not relevant to the search tree shown. Therefore, the answer is completely incorrect. |
| q1_31 | 0 | The algorithm identified by the LLM is incorrect. Also, the path identified by the LLM is wrong as it is not the path taken by the algorithm. |
| q1_32 | 0 | The LLM's answer is incorrect. The algorithm and heuristic are both wrong. The explanation for why the path is not optimal is also incorrect. |
| q1_33 | 0 | The algorithm identified is incorrect, as is the heuristic used. The cost calculation is also incorrect. Therefore, it's completely wrong. |
