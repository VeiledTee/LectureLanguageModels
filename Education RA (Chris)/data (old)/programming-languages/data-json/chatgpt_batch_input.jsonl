In a lazy language, a natural extension to this notion is whether a particular argument to a procedure is ever evaluated. In this problem, you will write type reconstruction rules that determine whether a particular expression evaluates a given argument. There are three possibilities for each argument: the procedure may always evaluate the argument, the procedure may never evaluate the argument, or the procedure may sometimes evaluate the argument; we represent these three values as A (for always), N (for never), and M (for maybe). Typing judgments have the form\n\n\\[A \\vdash E : T \\& S,\\] \n\nwhere \\(S\\) maps variables to strictness values. (You may assume that \\(S\\) always contains an entry for every variable that is ever used in the program, and furthermore that all variables are uniquely named. In other words, you don’t have to worry about scoping and variable capture.)\n\nFor example, a reasonable judgment in a program with 4 variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) might be\n\n\\[A \\vdash E : T \\& \\{a : M, b : A, c : N, d : M \\}.\\]\n\nand a reasonable typing rule might be\n\n\\[\\frac{A \\vdash E_1 : T \\& S_1 \\ ; \\ A \\vdash E_2 : T \\& S_2}{A \\vdash (\\text{strange } E_1 \\ E_2) : T \\& S_1 \\ \\text{AtoN}(S_2)} \\quad [\\text{strange}]\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\text{AtoN}\\) is defined below.\n\nProcedure types have the following form: \\((\\-> \\text{Ids } S \\ (T_1 \\ldots T_n) \\ T)\\). “Ids” is a list of the procedure’s parameter names. \\(S\\) is the strictness of the procedure (over all program variables, as usual).\n\nYour task is to extend the typing rules of Appendix C to also compute a strictness environment.\n\nYou may find one or more of the following auxiliary procedures to be helpful.

A communication variable can be assigned a value by `talk!`. An expression in `go` can wait for a communication variable to be given a value with `listen`. `listen` returns the value of the variable once it is set with `talk!`. For a program to be well typed, all \\(E_1\\) ... \\(E_n\\) in `go` must be well typed.\n\nCommunication variables will have the unique type `(commof T)` where T is the type of value they hold. This will ensure that only communication variables can be used with `talk!` and `listen`, and that communication variables cannot be used in any other expression.\n\nBen has given you the Scheme/R typing rules for `talk!` and `listen`:\n\n\\\\[\\\\frac{A \\\\vdash E : T \\\\quad A \\\\vdash I : (\\\\text{commof } T)}{A \\\\vdash (\\\\text{talk! } I E) : \\\\text{unit}}\\\\] [talk!]\n\n\\\\[\\\\frac{A \\\\vdash I : (\\\\text{commof } T)}{A \\\\vdash (\\\\text{listen } I) : T}\\\\] [listen]\n\n: Give the Scheme/R reconstruction algorithm for `go`."}],"max_tokens":2000}}

The good programmers over at Microsquish are excited because this means there is now a computer fast enough to run their dream programming language, TwoStack PostFix. In TwoStack PostFix, a program is a tuple of two command sequences, one per stack. For instance, to have one stack add the numbers 1 and 3 and have the other stack multiply \\(4*5\\), use the program\n\n<[1 3 add],[4 5 mul]>\n\nThe meaning of a TwoStack program is also a tuple, reporting the top of each stack at the end of the program. In the previous case, <4,20>.\n\nKeep in mind that the stacks are represented as completely separate entities at different locations in memory. Note that we will model errors as stuck states. For example, the program\n\n<[5 1 mul],[4 0 div]>\n\nshould get stuck. It is also a stuck state if one stack runs out of commands before the other. For instance,\n\n<[5 1 mul 3 add],[4 1 div]>\n\nshould get stuck right after the transition which performs the div command. Note that matching commands are executed simultaneously- that is, the 5 and 4 are pushed at the same time and the mul and the div are executed at the same time.\n\nFinally, Executives at Microsquish would like to implement a talk command allowing the two stacks to communicate. For now, do not worry about the transition rule for the talk command, but know that it requires the following domain updates:\n\n\\\\begin{tabular}{c c} \\(C\\) & \\(\\in\\) CommandPostFix+Talk \\\\\\\\ \\(C\\) & ::= ... existing PostFix commands ... \\\\\\\\  & | talk \\\\\\\\ \\(Q\\) & \\(\\in\\) CommandSpostFix+Talk = CommandPostFix+Talk* \\\\\\\\ \\(V\\) & \\(\\in\\) Value = IntLit + CommandSpostFix+Talk \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{tabular}\n\nIn addition, the transition relation for PostFix+Talk is the same as the relation for PostFix except it is updated to work with the new domains.

Define the Input, Output and Transition functions in terms of the PostFix+Talk functions. Use subscripting to express which domains the functions are over. For instance, \\(\\Rightarrow_{PostFix+Talk}\\) is the transition function for PostFix+Talk and \\(\\Rightarrow_{TwoStack}\\) is the transition function for TwoStack PostFix.\n\nBe sure to also define the set of final configurations of TwoStack Postfix, but do not worry about reporting errors for stuck states."}],"max_tokens":2000}}

Ben suggests to JavaHard that they include a region identifier in every procedure type:\n\n\\\\[T\\\\quad::=\\\\quad...|(\\\\rightarrow\\\\ \\\\ (T^{*})\\\\ T\\\\ R)\\\\]\n\nJust as regions are assigned to cells, every procedure will be assigned a new region identifier except when two procedures are aliased together.\n\nA procedure in E can be explicitly freed if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the procedure is in region R, (2) region R is not in the type of any free variables of E, and (3) region R is not in the type of E.\n\nExcited about explicit freedom, Ben invents a new primitive called (%procedure-free x) that frees the procedure represented by value x. In the following example, the lambda expression (lambda (y) y) is bound to x and freed:\n\n```scheme\n(let ((x (lambda (y) y)))\n  (%procedure-free x))\n```\n\nLet E be an expression that contains a non-nested lambda expression P. From effect analysis, we know that P's value is no longer needed after E completes. Thus, Ben would like to use (%procedure-free x) to free the procedure value corresponding to P. Help Ben by writing a translation function for E that will free the value of P and return the value of E. Use [v/P]E to substitute the variable v for lambda expression P in E. Assume that your translation occurs before MCPS conversion and that the variable v does not appear in E.\n\n\\\\[T[E]\\\\!=\\\\!(\\\\texttt{let }((v\\\\ P))\\\\\\\\ \\\\qquad\\\\ldots\\\\texttt{fill in text here}\\\\ldots\\\\ )\\\\]"}],"max_tokens":2000}}

JavaHard has recently realized that Java will not win in the marketplace against Scheme, and has adopted the 6.821 Scheme compiler as the cornerstone of their crash development effort. The following code was produced by the compiler after the desugar, globals/wrap, cps-convert, closures/flat-all, and lift-convert phases of compilation.\n\n```scheme\n(program\n  (define .lambda24.\n    (lambda (.closure11. .t5.)\n      (call-closure .t5. 1 (primop closure-ref .closure11. 1))))\n\n  (define .lambda21.\n    (lambda (.closure14. f g .k1.)\n      (call-closure .k1. (primop closure .lambda22. g f))))\n\n  (define .lambda22.\n    (lambda (.closure13. x .k2.)\n      (call-closure (primop closure-ref .closure13. 1) x\n                    (primop closure .lambda23. (primop closure-ref .closure13. 2) .k2.))))\n\n  (define .lambda23.\n    (lambda (.closure12. .t3.)\n      (call-closure (primop closure-ref .closure12. 1) .t3.\n                    (primop closure-ref .closure12. 2))))\n\n  (define .lambda20.\n    (lambda (.closure17. x) x))\n\n  (define .lambda19.\n    (lambda (.closure16. a .k9.)\n      (let ((.t10. (primop not a)))\n        (call-closure .k9. .t10.))))\n\n  (define .lambda18.\n    (lambda (.closure15. a .k7.)\n      (let ((.t8. (primop integer? a)))\n        (call-closure .k7. .t8.))))\n\n  (define *top* (primop closure .lambda20.))\n  (define not (primop closure .lambda19.))\n  (define integer? (primop closure .lambda18.)))\n\n(let (((compose (primop closure .lambda21.))))\n  (call-closure compose not integer? (primop closure .lambda24. *top*)))\n```\n\n: Ben revises his compiler to call this primitive to free all closures using your translation rule (assuming it works), and notes that certain programs slow down as a consequence. Ben had thought that reducing the work that the garbage collector had to do would make programs run faster. What is a possible explanation for this behavior?"}],"max_tokens":2000}}
