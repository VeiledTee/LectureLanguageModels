This means that adding either of these vertices to $S$ would violate independence, contradicting the fact that $S$ is a maximal independent set. \n\nTherefore, our assumption was incorrect and for each vertex $v \\in V$, $S$ can only contain one vertex of the form $(v, i)$.

Each process outputs its assigned color, which will be a number between 0 and \u2206.\n\nThis algorithm guarantees a (\u2206 + 1)-coloring of G because each process will have a unique color and adjacent vertices will have distinct colors. This is because each process will only increment its color if it receives a color that is already taken by one of its neighbors, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Additionally, since the maximum color is \u2206, there will always be enough colors for all vertices in G. Therefore, this algorithm"}}]}}}

Communication costs: The algorithm uses n\u00b2 point-to-point messages, as stated in Theorem 2. However, in this new graph G', the number of vertices is increased to n(\u2206+1), and the number of edges is increased to n(\u2206+1)(\u2206+1). This means that the total number of messages sent in this new graph is n(\u2206+1)(\u2206+1)\u00b2 = n(\u2206+1)\u00b3. Therefore, the expected communication cost is O(n(\u2206+1)\u00b3).\n\n3.
