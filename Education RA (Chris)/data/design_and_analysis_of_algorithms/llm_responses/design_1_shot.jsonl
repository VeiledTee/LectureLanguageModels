This is because, given his limited self-study time ($T$ hours) and the goal to learn as many pieces as possible, minimizing the total time spent on pieces allows for the maximum number of pieces to be learned. If he selects pieces with higher $p_i$ values instead, fewer pieces will be completed within his self-study and teaching budget.\n\n2. **Selecting the Highest $t_j$ Values**:\n   - For the pieces that he delegates to teachers, Prof. Chopin should assign them to the $k$ teachers with the highest available teaching hours, $t_j$. The rationale is that teachers with more available time can cover more of a piece (or possibly all of it), thereby reducing the amount of self-study time required by Prof. Chopin. This strategy maximizes the time efficiency for each piece, allowing more of his $T$ hours to be retained for other pieces or for learning more pieces.\n\nTherefore, by prioritizing the $k$ pieces with the lowest $p_i$ values and matching them with the $k$ teachers with the highest $t_j$ values, Prof. Chopin optimizes the use of both his self-study time and the teaching resources.
