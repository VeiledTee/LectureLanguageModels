Each entry in the list will represent a sighting, which includes the species \\( s \\), zone \\( i \\), and a timestamp when the sighting was recorded. This allows you to perform the `remove_oldest()` operation efficiently.\n   - **Species-Zone Map:** Use a nested hash map (or dictionary) structure, `map[species][zone]`, to keep track of the number of sightings for each species in each zone. This enables quick updates during the addition of sightings and efficient checks when determining if a species is common.\n   - **Common Species Set:** Maintain a set of species that are currently considered common. This helps to ensure that `is_common(s)` can be performed in \\( O(1) \\) time.\n\n2. **Operations:**\n\n   - **initialize():** Create an empty doubly linked list for the sightings log and initialize the nested hash map and common species set. This operation is clearly \\( O(1) \\) in worst-case time.\n\n   - **add_sighting(s, i):**\n     - Append the new sighting as a node to the end of the doubly linked list. This is an \\( O(1) \\) operation.\n     - Update the count in the map: `map[s][i] += 1`. Since hash map operations for insertions and updates are generally \\( O(1) \\), this update is \\( O(1) \\) expected time.\n     - Check if the species \\( s \\) now has 100 sightings in zone \\( i \\). If `map[s][i] \\geq 100` and \\( s \\) is not already in the common species set, add \\( s \\) to the set.\n     - Overall, this operation is performed in \\( O(1) \\) expected time, primarily limited by hash map operations which have \\( O(1) \\) expected time complexity.\n\n   - **remove_oldest():**\n     - Remove the oldest sighting node from the front of the doubly linked list. This is \\( O(1) \\).\n     - Adjust the count in the map: `map[s][i] -= 1` where \\( s \\) and \\( i \\) correspond to the species and zone of the removed sighting. As with `add_sighting`, this update takes \\( O(1) \\) expected time.\n     - If removing the sighting causes `map[s][i] < 100` for any common species \\( s \\), recompute common status for that species in zone \\( i \\). This might take up to \\( O(n) \\) time in the worst-case (if all sightings need reevaluation), but with careful management, updated information, and immediate adjustments to the set as needed, it remains efficient overall.\n     - This operation is primarily determined by the efficiency of maintaining the common status, which can be managed within \\( O(\\log n) \\) expected time, especially if worsening conditions are sparse.\n\n   - **is_common(s):**\n     - Simply check if \\( s \\) is in the common species set. Since this involves looking up a set, it takes \\( O(1) \\) worst-case time.\n\nBy organizing the database in this manner, we ensure that initialization, insertion, and simple existence checks are fast and efficient.

Instead, we can utilize **counting sort** or **radix sort**, which are capable of linear time sorting given certain constraints.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. Each pair \\((x_i, y_i)\\) has \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) satisfying \\(x_i, y_i < n^2\\).\n2. The power of each pair is calculated as \\(x_i + n^{y_i}\\).\n3. The function \\(n^{y_i}\\) dominates because it grows exponentially with base \\(n\\), while \\(x_i < n^2\\).\n\n### Description of the Algorithm:\n\n1. **Prepare for Sorting:**\n   - Construct an auxiliary array `C` such that `C[y_i]` will store pairs that have the same exponent \\(y_i\\).\n\n2. **Populate the Auxiliary Array:**\n   - Traverse each pair \\((x_i, y_i)\\) in the array `A`.\n   - For each pair, append \\((x_i, y_i)\\) into the list located at `C[y_i]`.\n\n3. **Counting Sort for Each Bucket (Based on \\(x_i\\)):**\n   - Since \\(x_i < n^2\\), within each list `C[y_i]`, perform a counting sort based on the value of \\(x_i\\).\n   - This can be done in \\(O(n)\\) time since the number of distinct \\(x_i\\) values is constrained and less than \\(n^2\\).\n\n4. **Combine Results:**\n   - Iterate through each list in the auxiliary array `C` from index \\(0\\) to the maximum \\(y_i\\) found (which will still be \\(< n^2\\)).\n   - Concatenate the results of counting sorts conducted on the lists in `C`.\n\nThis approach ensures that pairs are sorted first by the dominant term \\(n^{y_i}\\) and then by the smaller component \\(x_i\\), both in linear time relative to the number of pairs, thereby achieving the desired \\(O(n)\\) time complexity because:\n\n- The traversal and bucketing step is \\(O(n)\\).\n- Each counting sort execution is at most \\(O(n)\\).\n\n### Final sorted order:\nThe pairs are processed increasingly by their power \\(x_i + n^{y_i}\\), which is guaranteed since:\n- For the same \\(y_i\\), sorting by \\(x_i\\) gives correct relative order.\n- Processing lists in increasing order of \\(y_i\\) ensures that exponential differences in power are respected.\n\nThus, the algorithm efficiently sorts the array of pairs by their respective powers in \\(O(n)\\) time.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 272, "completion_tokens": 603, "total_tokens": 875, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_f9f4fb6dbf"}}, "error": null}
