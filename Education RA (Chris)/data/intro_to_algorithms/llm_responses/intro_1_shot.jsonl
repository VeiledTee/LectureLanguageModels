Here is a high-level description of the algorithm:\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\n1. **Formulate as a Flow Problem:**\n   - Construct a bipartite graph where:\n     - There are source vertex \\( S \\), sink vertex \\( T \\), and \\( 3n + 3 \\) vertices corresponding to students and rooms.\n     - There are vertices for each student \\( i \\), each room \\( j \\in \\{a, b, c\\} \\), and the source and sink.\n\n2. **Graph Construction:**\n   - From the source node \\( S \\), connect edges to each student \\( i \\) with capacity 1.\n   - Connect each student \\( i \\) to room node \\( j \\) if their benefit \\( a_i > 0 \\), \\( b_i > 0 \\), \\( c_i > 0 \\) has corresponding positivity with the benefit value as capacity.\n   - Connect each room node \\( j \\) to the sink \\( T \\) with capacity \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Graph Constraint Translation:**\n   - Each student needs to go to exactly one room where they have non-zero benefit; this ensures creating only strictly positive assignments.\n   - Each room needs to have exactly \\( n \\) students assigned.\n\n4. **Maximum Flow Computation:**\n   - Compute the maximum flow from the source \\( S \\) to the sink \\( T \\) using the Ford-Fulkerson method, Edmonds-Karp implementation (BFS-based, running in \\( O(VE^2) \\)).\n   - This check ensures that each room receives exactly \\( n \\) students.\n\n5. **Determine Feasibility and Calculate Maximum Benefit:**\n   - If the maximum flow is \\( 3n \\), then the assignment is feasible.\n   - Traverse the resulting flow network, summing the benefits on the selected paths from \\( S \\) to \\( T \\) to compute the total benefit.\n\n6. **Time Complexity:**\n   - The graph has vertices for \\( 3n \\) students and \\( 3 \\) rooms plus source and sink.\n   - There are potentially up to \\( 3n \\) student-to-room connections plus \\( O(n) \\) other edges, yielding \\( O(n^2) \\) total edges.\n   - Flow computation time is \\( O(VE^2) = O((3n + 2) \\times (n^4)) = O(n^5) \\).\n   - However, this is undesirable given the problem constraints, using more efficient techniques or constraint setup can retrieve \\( O(n^3) \\) practical implementations.\n\nThis generic algorithm gives a feasible way to determine the possibility and maximize benefit, albeit with added refactoring, specific graph simplification, and flow recalculations potential for optimal results.
