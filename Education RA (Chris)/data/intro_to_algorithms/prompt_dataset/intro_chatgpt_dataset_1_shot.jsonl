Then [b/2] minus the weight of a minimum-weight path from s to t in G would correspond to the maximum energy Bellham could have upon reaching t; or at least it would be if she did not either exceed or exhaust her tank along the way.First we show that every minimum-weight path from s to t in G is simple. It suffices to show that every directed cycle in G has positive weight. Consider cycle (c\u2080, ..., c\u2096\u208b\u2081, c\u2096 = c\u2080). C has weight \u2211\u1d62\u208c\u2081\u1d4f J(c\u1d62\u208b\u2081, c\u1d62) > \u2211\u1d62\u208c\u2081\u1d4f mg(h(c\u1d62) - h(c\u1d62\u208b\u2081)) = 0, as desired.Any simple path in G traverses at most n - 1 edges, so the magnitude of its weight is at most (n - 1)k < b/2. Thus [b/2] minus the weight of any simple path in G will always be > 0 and < b (so Bellham cannot exhaust or exceed her tank by driving on a simple path from s to t).Lastly, we find the weight of a minimum-weight path from s to t by solving SSSP. Unfortunately using Bellman-Ford takes O(n\u00b2) time which is too slow. However, we can re-weight edges in G to be positive while preserving shortest paths by exploiting the provided vertex potentials, similar to Johnson's algorithm. Specifically, create new graph G', identical to G, except change the weight of each edge (u, v) to J(u, v) \u2013 mg(h(v) \u2013 h(u)) > 0. This transformation preserves shortest paths since the weight of each path from, e.g., a to b changes by the same amount, namely by mg(h(b) \u2013 h(a)). So run Dijkstra from s to find the minimum weight D of any path to t in G', and return [b/2] \u2013 (D \u2013 mg(h(b) \u2013 h(a))).Constructing G takes O(n) time, reweighting to G' also takes O(n) time, and then running Dijkstra from s in G' takes O(n log n) time, leading to O(n log n) time in total."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Context: Problem 2.

Then #v(v) = v.left.size if v has a left child and zero otherwise; and can be computed in O(1) time. Then, for every ancestor of u starting from v, we compute #v(u.parent) from #(u). There are two cases:\n\u2022 Case 1, u is the left child of u.parent: then all the nodes preceding v in the subtree of u.parent are in the subtree of u, so set #v(u.parent) = #(u).\n\u2022 Case 2, u is the right child of u.parent: then all nodes in the left subtree of u.parent precede v (as does u), so set #v(u.parent) = 1+u.parent.left.size + #v(u).\nThen return #v(r), since this is the number of nodes preceding v in r's subtree (i.e., the entire tree). Correctness is argued within the algorithm description.
