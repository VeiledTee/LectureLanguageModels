The decision boundary between two different-class points is the locus of points equidistant to those two points. For multiple points, the decision boundary becomes the collection of all such boundaries.\n\n2. **Steps to Draw Decision Boundaries**:\n   - **Identify Voronoi Cells**: The decision boundaries for 1-NN are essentially the edges of the Voronoi diagram for the training points.

Here's a general method to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Model Structure:**\n   - A multi-layer neural network generally consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. \n   - Each layer is composed of neurons, and each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs.\n\n2. **Activation Functions:**\n   - Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).\n   - For regression tasks, the output layer typically uses a linear activation function to predict continuous values.\n\n3. **Forward Propagation:**\n   - Inputs are fed into the input layer, and data is transformed through the hidden layers using weights and biases.\n   - The transformation at each neuron can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     z = W \\cdot x + b\n     \\]\n     where \\(z\\) is the pre-activation value, \\(W\\) is the weight matrix, \\(x\\) is the input vector, and \\(b\\) is the bias.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - For regression, the final output is a continuous variable computed by the output layer.\n   - The output can be visualized as a smooth curve or surface if the input is one-dimensional or two-dimensional, respectively.\n\n5. **Example Visualization:**\n   - Suppose you have a one-dimensional input and the task is to regress a sine wave. The network might output a curve that closely fits the sine wave, demonstrating its ability to learn complex patterns.\n\n6. **Training Process:**\n   - The network is trained using a loss function, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression:\n     \\[\n     L(y, \\hat{y}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n     \\]\n     where \\(y\\) is the true value and \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted value.\n\nIn summary, to analyze the regression outputs of a multi-layer neural network, you would look at the smoothness and accuracy of the output function's fit to the actual data, focusing on how well it generalizes to the underlying data distribution.
