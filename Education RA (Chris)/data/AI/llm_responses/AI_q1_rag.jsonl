However, in a breadth-first exploration, the optimal move may not necessarily be the one that leads to the highest or lowest score, as it may be found at a shallower depth in the tree.\n\nOne advantage of using breadth-first search in this application is that it guarantees finding the optimal solution, as it explores all possible paths in the game tree.

This is because progressive-deepening search combines the advantages of both depth-first search (small space requirements) and breadth-first search (guaranteed finding of the shallowest goal). By using iterative deepening, the algorithm can explore the game tree to a pre-specified depth, but also continue to explore deeper levels if time allows. This allows for a more efficient use of time and resources, as the algorithm can stop once a solution is found, rather than continuing to explore the entire tree. Additionally, by using the results of the previous iteration, the algorithm can make more informed decisions about which branches to explore, potentially leading to earlier cutoffs and a more efficient search.

The path it found was A (1) \u2192 B (5) \u2192 D (4) \u2192 C (1) \u2192 G (0), with a total cost of 11. The optimal path, as determined by the sum of link costs, is A (1) \u2192 B (4) \u2192 D (3) \u2192 G (0), with a total cost of 8. This is because the heuristic function used in this algorithm is not admissible, meaning it overestimates the actual cost to reach the goal. In this case, the heuristic function overestimates the cost to reach C and D, leading to a suboptimal path."}}]}}}
