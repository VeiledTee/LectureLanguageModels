If we use backtracking with forward checking (BT-FC) but with dynamic variable ordering, using the most-constrained-variable strategy, give a list of all the variable assignments attempted, in sequence. If there is a tie between variables, use the lowest-numbered one first. Use the notation variable = color for assignments, for example, 1=R. | Assignment:   | None     | 5 = B    | 2= R   | 1= B   | 3= B   | 4= R   | |---------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------| | Domain of 1:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  |        |        |        | | Domain of 2:  | { R, B } | { R }    |        |        |        |        | | Domain of 3:  | { R, B } | { R, B } | { B }  | { B }  |        |        | | Domain of 4:  | { R, B } | { R }    | { R }  | { R }  | { R }  |        | | Domain of 5:  | { B }    |          |        |        |        |        | { }"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With dynamic ordering, the sequence becomes:\n```\nAssignment:    None  \u2192  5 = B  \u2192  2 = R  \u2192  1 = B  \u2192  3 = B  \u2192  4 = R\n\nDomain of 1:   {R, B} \u2192 {R, B} \u2192 {B}   \u2192 B   \u2192 B   \u2192 B\nDomain of 2:   {R, B} \u2192 {R}   \u2192 R   \u2192 R   \u2192 R   \u2192 R\nDomain of 3:   {R, B} \u2192 {R, B} \u2192 {B}   \u2192 {B} \u2192 B   \u2192 B\nDomain of 4:   {R, B} \u2192 {R}   \u2192 {R}   \u2192 {R} \u2192 {R} \u2192 R\nDomain of 5:   {B}    \u2192 B      \u2192 B   \u2192 B   \u2192 B   \u2192 B\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Context: \n\n**Problem 10**\n\nQuestion: 6.034 Quiz 1, Spring 2005 > 3 Constraint satisfaction (24 points) You are trying to schedule observations on the space telescope.
